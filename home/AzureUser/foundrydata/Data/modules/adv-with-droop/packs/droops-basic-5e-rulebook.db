Like most habitations in Oeble, that particular tenement had been built for humans, and smaller residents coped with the resulting awkwardness as best they could.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2b6b98f0-fac6-411a-8755-51dc80ad382f\">But at least the relative largeness of the apartment gave Burgell room to pack in all his gnome-sized gear. The front room was his workshop, and it contained a bewildering miscellany of tools: hammers, chisels, saws, lockpicks, tinted lenses, jeweler&rsquo;s loupes, and jars of powdered and shredded ingredients for casting spells. A fat gray cat, the mage&rsquo;s familiar, lay curled atop a grimoire. It opened its eyes, gave Aeron a disdainful yellow stare, then appeared to go back to sleep.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0dbc513e-a1b0-42bc-b5cf-514b608016a3\">&mdash;&nbsp;Richard Lee Byers,&nbsp;The&nbsp;Black Bouquet</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"97ea24d5-d49c-46ba-946f-92c88932597a\">A constant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens and neighborhoods where gnomes form their close-knit communities. Louder sounds punctuate the hum: a crunch of grinding gears here, a minor explosion there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially bursts of laughter. Gnomes take delight in life, enjoying every moment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and play.</p>\n<h3 id=\"VibrantExpression\" data-content-chunk-id=\"0b2864cd-0fd1-49e3-a5f6-553bf2f618cd\">Vibrant Expression</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a45153d6-918f-43d2-b727-362d3deee568\">A gnome&rsquo;s energy and enthusiasm for living shines through every inch of his or her tiny body. Gnomes average slightly over 3 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their tan or brown faces are usually adorned with broad smiles (beneath their prodigious noses), and their bright eyes shine with excitement. Their fair hair has a tendency to stick out in every direction, as if expressing the gnome&rsquo;s insatiable interest in everything around.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a252a92b-7f36-499f-832a-3294b6d35604\">A gnome&rsquo;s personality is writ large in his or her appearance. A male gnome&rsquo;s beard, in contrast to his wild hair, is kept carefully trimmed but often styled into curious forks or neat points. A gnome&rsquo;s clothing, though usually made in modest earth tones, is elaborately decorated with embroidery, embossing, or gleaming jewels.</p>\n<h3 id=\"DelightedDedication\" data-content-chunk-id=\"324a68fc-7162-4f4e-a643-98954ed70cbb\">Delighted Dedication</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9596e398-0bd8-40e1-aafa-095b3cd3b3a1\"><a href=\"http://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/638/gnome1.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\" data-content-chunk-id=\"f3e9209f-1c8c-4c84-83d7-79b3e72ee53e\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/638/300/360/gnome1.png\" alt=\"\" data-content-chunk-id=\"998ed889-905a-4cac-a432-b20293c5cdec\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d4fa173d-ad71-45c6-b0ad-014624e78972\">As far as gnomes are concerned, being alive is a wonderful thing, and they squeeze every ounce of enjoyment out of their three to five centuries of life. Humans might wonder about getting bored over the course of such a long life, and elves take plenty of time to savor the beauties of the world in their long years, but gnomes seem to worry that even with all that time, they can&rsquo;t get in enough of the things they want to do and see.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c6b0e951-6885-45f3-80a8-249df4425950\">Gnomes speak as if they can&rsquo;t get the thoughts out of their heads fast enough. Even as they offer ideas and opinions on a range of subjects, they still manage to listen carefully to others, adding the appropriate exclamations of surprise and appreciation along the way.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"873c62cc-b4f5-4e47-8d89-ef05a588daf5\">Though gnomes love jokes of all kinds, particularly puns and pranks, they&rsquo;re just as dedicated to the more serious tasks they undertake. Many gnomes are skilled engineers, alchemists, tinkers, and inventors. They&rsquo;re willing to make mistakes and laugh at themselves in the process of perfecting what they do, taking bold (sometimes foolhardy) risks and dreaming large.</p>\n<h3 id=\"BrightBurrows\" data-content-chunk-id=\"cd03addf-b213-452c-93e1-0fe69c1b09c3\">Bright Burrows</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c35bae50-e62c-4fe1-b06a-a1ebfb4b88af\">Gnomes make their homes in hilly, wooded lands. They live underground but get more fresh air than dwarves do, enjoying the natural, living world on the surface whenever they can. Their homes are well hidden by both clever construction and simple illusions. Welcome visitors are quickly ushered into the bright, warm burrows. Those who are not welcome are unlikely to find the burrows in the&nbsp;first place.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a1039e9a-0987-4038-9217-523bc9f9a702\">Gnomes who settle in human lands are commonly gemcutters, engineers, sages, or tinkers. Some human families retain gnome tutors, ensuring that their pupils enjoy a mix of serious learning and delighted enjoyment. A gnome might tutor several generations of a single human family over the course of his or her long life.</p>\n<blockquote data-content-chunk-id=\"d9376077-bd4a-42e8-8fc0-aa9ec9fbdbff\">\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4fdcd66f-1467-4404-9be5-2e51affb4ead\">ALWAYS APPRECIATIVE</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9027d185-02e3-47b9-9914-3e68d3fcbe68\">It&rsquo;s rare for a gnome to be hostile or malicious unless he or she has suffered a grievous injury. Gnomes know that most races don&rsquo;t share their sense of humor, but they enjoy anyone&rsquo;s company just as they enjoy everything else they set out to do.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"GnomeNames\" data-content-chunk-id=\"06e4f09e-54b6-43f3-bf67-ad49e20c21d5\">Gnome Names</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e7faa72f-aacc-4527-a59f-8341296495e0\">Gnomes love names, and most have half a dozen or so. A gnome&rsquo;s mother, father, clan elder, aunts, and uncles each give the gnome a name, and various nicknames from just about everyone else might or might not stick over time. Gnome names are typically variants on the names of ancestors or distant relatives, though some are purely new inventions. When dealing with humans and others who are &ldquo;stuffy&rdquo; about names, a gnome learns to use no more than three names: a personal name, a clan name, and a nickname, choosing the one in each category that&rsquo;s the most fun to say.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"42168c9f-e48c-47ed-9982-090d7c8fa4d2\">Male Names:&nbsp;Alston, Alvyn, Boddynock, Brocc, Burgell, Dimble, Eldon, Erky, Fonkin, Frug, Gerbo, Gimble, Glim, Jebeddo, Kellen, Namfoodle, Orryn, Roondar, Seebo, Sindri, Warryn, Wrenn, Zook</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"497dc5ba-4223-4b2b-9d69-4ddf74f1d194\">Female Names:&nbsp;Bimpnottin, Breena, Caramip, Carlin, Donella, Duvamil, Ella, Ellyjobell, Ellywick, Lilli, Loopmottin, Lorilla, Mardnab, Nissa, Nyx, Oda, Orla, Roywyn, Shamil, Tana, Waywocket, Zanna</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ed59b151-41d8-4f86-b623-210d9200c7c1\">Clan Names:&nbsp;Beren, Daergel, Folkor, Garrick, Nackle, Murnig, Ningel, Raulnor, Scheppen, Timbers, Turen</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ce249fb2-19ca-44b1-909a-94a5c1d62361\">Nicknames:&nbsp;Aleslosh, Ashhearth, Badger, Cloak, Doublelock, Filchbatter, Fnipper, Ku, Nim, Oneshoe, Pock, Sparklegem, Stumbleduck</p>\n<h3 id=\"SeeingtheWorld\" data-content-chunk-id=\"a0655e1d-2b0f-4e3f-8466-c5f3ca32f93d\">Seeing the World</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"96df8331-c267-439d-814f-efb6fe79d16e\">Curious and impulsive, gnomes might take up adventuring as a way to see the world or for the love of exploring. As lovers of gems and other fine items, some gnomes take to adventuring as a quick, if dangerous, path to wealth. Regardless of what spurs them to adventure, gnomes who adopt this way of life eke as much enjoyment out of it as they do out of any other activity they undertake, sometimes to the great annoyance of their adventuring companions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"GnomeTraits\" data-content-chunk-id=\"2e17c21d-11ca-422b-ba91-750a0295041a\">Gnome Traits</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d373eb4b-1595-447f-8983-4aa6e6aff453\">Your gnome character has certain characteristics in common with all&nbsp;other gnomes.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"cd86d186-1d9f-488a-9959-e65d8ad6aac5\">Ability Score Increase.&nbsp;Your Intelligence score increases by 2.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9a03f21c-a61e-4460-93a2-325ce4ab7cbc\">Age.&nbsp;Gnomes mature at the same rate humans do, and most are expected to settle down into an adult life by around age 40. They can live 350 to almost 500 years.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f5ded708-10f6-471d-9bbe-9c55c85aab16\">Alignment.&nbsp;Gnomes are most often good. Those who tend toward law are sages, engineers, researchers, scholars, investigators, or inventors. Those who tend toward chaos are minstrels, tricksters, wanderers, or fanciful jewelers. Gnomes are good-hearted, and even the tricksters among them are more playful&nbsp;than vicious.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b4c23881-9d2d-477d-bbf4-56c00520801c\">Size.&nbsp;Gnomes are between 3 and 4 feet tall and average about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6d447c56-fd3d-4b05-9022-8fc04fd932fe\">Speed.&nbsp;Your base walking speed is 25 feet.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f842e9b0-364b-476f-a72b-82550e0e8ef4\">Darkvision.&nbsp;Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can&rsquo;t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5f116de0-db48-458f-8080-86510c22ef5e\">Gnome Cunning.&nbsp;You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3aaadd01-b0a4-451c-83c6-c836c2aa8d8c\">Languages.&nbsp;You can speak, read, and write Common and Gnomish. The Gnomish language, which uses the Dwarvish script, is renowned for its technical treatises and its catalogs of knowledge about the natural world.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"49ce0306-6e88-40dc-8d7c-73e5c45264e4\">Subrace.&nbsp;Two subraces of gnomes are found among the worlds of D&amp;D: forest gnomes and rock gnomes. Choose one of these subraces.</p>\n<blockquote data-content-chunk-id=\"07707af3-b83f-467f-963b-ca1f336e35b7\">\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0666f301-927c-4b59-884c-2d733e1e207d\">DEEP GNOMES</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"45dbfb90-daa5-47be-83d6-e72476a55628\">A third subrace of gnomes, the deep gnomes (or svirfneblin), live in small communities scattered in the Underdark. Unlike the duergar and the drow, svirfneblin are as good as their surface cousins. However, their humor and enthusiasm are dampened by their oppressive environment, and their inventive expertise is directed mostly toward stonework.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"ForestGnome\" data-content-chunk-id=\"182fa1bf-dde8-40d6-a460-e0f95f8ee9eb\">&nbsp;</h3>\n<h3 id=\"RockGnome\" data-content-chunk-id=\"c8cec312-740f-41d6-a683-aa97d278f801\">Rock Gnome</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6fe5790b-371f-41ef-837b-fe999a0188f0\">As a rock gnome, you have a natural inventiveness and hardiness beyond that of other gnomes. Most gnomes in the worlds of D&amp;D are rock gnomes, including the tinker gnomes of the Dragonlance setting.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e953af83-77db-4580-a601-c870b29a4383\">Ability Score Increase.&nbsp;Your Constitution score increases by 1.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"19e20a2d-4ea3-4598-9a8a-1fef302e397a\">Artificer&rsquo;s Lore.&nbsp;Whenever you make an Intelligence (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#History\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/7-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">History</a>) check related to magic items, alchemical objects, or technological devices, you can add twice your proficiency bonus, instead of any proficiency bonus you normally apply.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5faab689-64ca-4762-abf7-679bbbf3633c\">Tinker.&nbsp;You have proficiency with artisan&rsquo;s tools (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/tinkers-tools\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/adventuring-gear/116-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">tinker&rsquo;s tools</a>). Using those tools, you can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up to three such devices active at a time.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0fb9bc47-46f8-4c19-b22a-6d0f946b359d\">When you create a device, choose one of the following options:</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c87efb24-fb9f-4df1-b5de-72df29214fd9\">Clockwork Toy.&nbsp;This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier.

Many adventurers also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting arms and armor, performing research, or spending their hard-earned gold.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2331769c-923f-466b-9edf-991331622001\">In some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the DM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your character has been doing. At other times, the DM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion.</p>\n<h3 id=\"LifestyleExpenses\" data-content-chunk-id=\"86185686-39f8-4550-968a-185e244a7b7d\">Lifestyle Expenses</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1e95290d-64f7-4eb4-8e66-da6ba3e6e20a\">Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"dc6d5491-ce39-40e1-ab2a-1d51c36f6121\">Living a particular lifestyle doesn't have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live in poverty.</p>\n<h3 id=\"DowntimeActivities\" data-content-chunk-id=\"502a25f9-b55f-4a2b-ba4e-b5896c301ed8\">Downtime Activities</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6be27835-8edf-452c-a225-e8021cf445d2\">Between adventures, the DM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c5747d73-2246-4555-b52c-bef60cfca56e\">Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your DM.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Crafting\" data-content-chunk-id=\"d78fa804-0867-492b-95f0-cb8b11f95c82\">Crafting</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4f256a4f-e188-4d9a-ab6f-151488376940\">You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan's tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with smith's tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"00a099f3-624e-4b57-9408-b81a4fc40782\">For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every day in 5-gp increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e3a3f533-216a-4a86-8d89-ab92ffe0198d\">Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"50792df2-4b89-4814-be1f-fd0e5f44207c\">While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost.</p>\n<h4 id=\"PracticingaProfession\" data-content-chunk-id=\"b4c8f3e2-f1a3-4150-9d3b-3ba912d634f7\">Practicing a Profession</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"250ca9c5-ee38-43dc-ac03-f7295c788e75\">You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day.

The being must be known to you: a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature&rsquo;s name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (DM&rsquo;s choice).</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d7b78565-4071-4433-a307-f240f7844e68\">When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn&rsquo;t obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"63054edd-13b1-47f0-869c-2196a01b921d\">Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"78955da0-8fd4-4cb7-a323-d8f440f40452\">As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature&rsquo;s ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0e23a44e-0d35-4423-9a38-77030e9df50f\">After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature&rsquo;s service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"df9b604d-c884-43dd-ade4-2ea2a2e887bc\">A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.</p>\n<h3 id=\"PlanarBinding\" data-content-chunk-id=\"f54f958b-6455-429d-aaa2-4133f2c432d8\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/planar-binding\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2205-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Planar Binding</a></h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a4e90ddb-0596-4c84-9a7a-42bbf706a0af\">5th-level abjuration</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1f9081f2-8766-4521-9cea-7cfc5d18b6f8\">Casting&nbsp;Time:&nbsp;1 hour</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"919ea85e-b292-4a20-913e-b47a3598bd27\">Range:&nbsp;60 feet</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"dd028fdd-2fc5-4637-babf-2c4e26723ec3\">Components:&nbsp;V, S, M (a jewel worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d6fa051b-79bd-4bca-9aad-86b8d8f51f2c\">Duration:&nbsp;24 hours</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"83aa46c1-225b-40c2-95b3-5655cad298dd\">With this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend to your service. The creature must be within range for the entire casting of the spell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned into the center of an inverted&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/magic-circle\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2174-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">magic circle</a>&nbsp;in order to keep it trapped while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting, the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or created by another spell, that spell&rsquo;s duration is extended to match the duration of this spell.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"63ac4726-0503-4af8-ae6d-660b0f30d3c9\">A bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The creature obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your instructions completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane of existence, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8f6542c3-7d0b-447c-ba6c-c586115bb56b\">At Higher Levels.&nbsp;When you cast this spell using a spell slot of a higher level, the duration increases to 10 days with a 6th-level slot, to 30 days with a 7th-level slot, to 180 days with an 8th-level slot, and to a year and a day with a 9th-level spell slot.</p>\n<h3 id=\"PlaneShift\" data-content-chunk-id=\"0bc3f3af-5f2e-4c6e-b1bc-1fa39553fa50\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/plane-shift\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2206-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Plane Shift</a></h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"61905519-9ab8-4ad6-8209-2bd5dff8e51a\">7th-level conjuration</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2d6a44df-d4e6-4b99-a009-dfa51452cde5\">Casting Time:&nbsp;1 action</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c9c9bdce-ad68-466c-ad10-75d4b6701325\">Range:&nbsp;Touch</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f8b909a2-4052-4e91-a39d-0c32adf81858\">Components:&nbsp;V, S, M (a forked, metal rod worth at least 250 gp, attuned to a particular plane of existence)</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ad2423f7-2482-4de5-a60f-eb82caab06ce\">Duration:&nbsp;Instantaneous</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f2714434-726d-4012-8fb7-9ea30666519d\">You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported to a different plane of existence. You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level of the Nine Hells, and you appear in or near that destination. If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example, you might arrive in its Street of Steel, before its Gate of Ashes, or looking at the city from across the Sea of Fire, at the DM&rsquo;s discretion.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4789cf5c-b2b2-44a1-8be2-1ae1a278c4e2\">Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f058d123-d488-4df4-936e-be2a06e4eb4d\">You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. Choose a creature within your reach and make a melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw.

{"name":"Multiclassing","permission":{"default":0,"s7gxOGja1p9WAX4j":3},"flags":{},"content":"<p data-content-chunk-id=\"81a20de6-a8cd-4219-8dac-f5647d0f8a47\">The combination of ability scores, race, class, and background defines your character&rsquo;s capabilities in the game, and the personal details you create set your character apart from every other character. Even within your class and race, you have options to fine-tune what your character can do. But a few players &mdash; with the DM&rsquo;s permission &mdash; want to go a step further.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"dbab9f46-421c-4638-ad01-e586cc402c10\">This section&nbsp;defines two optional sets of rules for customizing your character: multiclassing and feats. Multiclassing lets you combine classes together, and feats are special options you can choose instead of increasing your ability scores as you gain levels. Your DM decides whether these options are available in a campaign.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Multiclassing\" data-content-chunk-id=\"dc193d55-f2f3-4fb6-be39-a319c1bef83b\">Multiclassing</h2>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"77e64399-5ce8-421d-9c61-998f54553773\">Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2b1fe632-37c9-42ac-887d-788d4b4358c4\">With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in wizard and two in fighter, you're a 5th-level character.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"708f4f41-71e8-49a0-80dc-5672e5e74fdb\">As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you'll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Prerequisites\" data-content-chunk-id=\"7ab6f2be-18ea-4b5d-9c62-c1b1be512244\">Prerequisites</h2>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ef55d5e7-ee6c-4da8-9a4f-7cfcea488824\">To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a barbarian who decides to multiclass into the druid class must have both Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.</p>\n<div>\n<table id=\"multiclassingminimum\" data-content-chunk-id=\"145e0363-878e-424b-828b-ff7bbe40f937\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Class</th>\n<th>Ability Score Minimum</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Barbarian</td>\n<td>Strength 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bard</td>\n<td>Charisma 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cleric</td>\n<td>Wisdom 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Druid</td>\n<td>Wisdom 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fighter</td>\n<td>Strength 13 or Dexterity 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monk</td>\n<td>Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Paladin</td>\n<td>Strength 13 and Charisma 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ranger</td>\n<td>Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rogue</td>\n<td>Dexterity 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sorcerer</td>\n<td>Charisma 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Warlock</td>\n<td>Charisma 13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wizard</td>\n<td>Intelligence 13</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"ExperiencePoints\" data-content-chunk-id=\"19a9d585-144b-441e-9284-936cd16af1e7\">Experience Points</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e5223049-1e15-43af-a9ba-5b11e0f6b460\">The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are a cleric 6/fighter 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a fighter or your seventh level as a cleric.</p>\n<h3 id=\"HitPointsandHitDice\" data-content-chunk-id=\"0877f44a-09c0-4c56-9ea9-d71f8ca22a55\">Hit Points and Hit Dice</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"16c26b58-a11c-4d9d-a85b-5bb8c5c99a42\"><a href=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/4/979/107.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/4/979/350/242/107.png\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"47c5c0b9-b422-4b8e-9f0a-d68957015f3e\">You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"38932b60-ea4e-4ca4-8129-1b8b7835a630\">You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the fighter and the paladin have a d10, so if you are a paladin 5/fighter 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a paladin 5/cleric 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ProficiencyBonus\" data-content-chunk-id=\"8e935b85-4518-4392-9e96-29436997dc4d\">Proficiency Bonus</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"243f8d61-90dc-4093-b83a-2f71da93b4bc\">Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class. For example, if you are a fighter 3/rogue 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Proficiencies\" data-content-chunk-id=\"940b412b-00b4-4c6f-9d13-8ea65a69af0b\">Proficiencies</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c7bd97bc-cb31-4e08-a498-fd95c8d37097\">When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of new class's starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.</p>\n<h4 id=\"MulticlassingProficiencies\" data-content-chunk-id=\"723bf323-d161-45ba-bf08-3a9959120517\">Multiclassing Proficiencies</h4>\n<div>\n<table id=\"multiclassingproficiencies\" data-content-chunk-id=\"3438ef5a-3d48-49a3-bb2d-fb15d6d5b645\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Class</th>\n<th>Proficiencies Gained</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Barbarian</td>\n<td>Shields, simple weapons, martial weapons</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bard</td>\n<td>Light armor, one skill of your choice, one musical instrument of your choice</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cleric</td>\n<td>Light armor, medium armor, shields</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Druid</td>\n<td>Light armor, medium armor, shields (druids will not wear armor or use shields made of metal)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fighter</td>\n<td>Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monk</td>\n<td>Simple weapons, shortswords</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Paladin</td>\n<td>Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ranger</td>\n<td>Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons, one skill from the class's skill list</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rogue</td>\n<td>Light armor, one skill from the class's skill list, thieves' tools</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sorcerer</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Warlock</td>\n<td>Light armor, simple weapons</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wizard</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"ClassFeatures\" data-content-chunk-id=\"09e77cf6-e9be-4ceb-9e0f-9bc20bbbd004\">Class Features</h2>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"fa29cf57-3a1c-4b58-95db-c9110fb4d04b\">When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.</p>\n<h4 id=\"ChannelDivinity\" data-content-chunk-id=\"31c27854-86f1-4721-8339-18246d1baa7e\">Channel Divinity</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"dfa3c48b-abe3-49d2-b8b6-964d7500f4b1\">If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.</p>\n<h4 id=\"ExtraAttack\" data-content-chunk-id=\"fa091373-120c-4af3-8669-6491bf57a1b8\">Extra Attack</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"279533ab-cf9a-4ac7-b194-62b0754a3e9d\">If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does). Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.</p>\n<h4 id=\"UnarmoredDefense\" data-content-chunk-id=\"e790b1f6-3b86-47ab-a442-707203308bae\">Unarmored Defense</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"95ff673f-e54b-462e-8548-0c022dd1c9d6\">If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"95ff673f-e54b-462e-8548-0c022dd1c9d6\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"Spellcasting\" data-content-chunk-id=\"aa97bf10-8fc5-4bc2-9ff0-3d929d5d8bb8\">Spellcasting</h2>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"94054225-acdc-4cfa-b924-d78ed06edb1e\">Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8f0f8086-3d06-4c3e-a389-7454b0cf3889\">Spells Known and Prepared.&nbsp;You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ea950d4e-23cb-4356-aeb3-ee2200bb2419\">Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"25725ceb-ee55-4ac1-9c14-1d45eac24c71\">Spell Slots.&nbsp;You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, and half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d7f827a8-864a-46ba-8709-bbcf5d350a59\">If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells.

The character classes are described in the&nbsp;<a title=\"Classes\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/classes\" data-content-chunk-id=\"b4c93aef-e088-4393-a5a9-49e861a002ac\">Classes</a>&nbsp;section.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4c0d6cce-b4ec-4563-8af1-1c43e99310ca\">Your character receives a number of benefits from your choice of class. Many of these benefits are&nbsp;class features&nbsp;&mdash; capabilities (including spellcasting) that set your character apart from members of other classes.

Your proficiencies define many of the things your character can do particularly well, from using certain weapons to telling a convincing lie.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"626c088e-de30-48a5-8a0a-e0ab2f4526b7\">On your character sheet, record all the features that your class gives you at 1st level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Level\" data-content-chunk-id=\"dd08ef10-5350-4640-87fd-7ed6d1c17092\">Level</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"bb0b42e9-8505-4700-a5d8-389525d0fd7d\">Typically, a character starts at 1st level and advances in level by adventuring and gaining&nbsp;experience points&nbsp;(XP).

In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6c4de27c-57ab-4e97-ab2e-18838bfd6833\">3. Resolve the attack.&nbsp;You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5c415bd3-3de8-4752-b259-27694832dafa\">If there's ever any question whether something you're doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you're making an attack roll, you're making an attack.</p>\n<h3 id=\"AttackRolls\" data-content-chunk-id=\"67a5fad3-6e4b-41a5-aa22-2fc5abcf32a4\">Attack Rolls</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c77bd08f-d3ab-4a74-b837-693ec4dca0b8\">When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its stat block.</p>\n<h4 id=\"ModifierstotheRoll\" data-content-chunk-id=\"00df9184-9e33-48d5-8431-64ceb946e1e5\">Modifiers to the Roll</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2ff31657-01fd-4b9a-9575-22e233b2d7cf\">When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character's proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3895a4d4-2828-4507-9cb3-c6b39393c2b2\">Ability Modifier.&nbsp;The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this rule.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b4016873-c908-4247-bbb4-1d8a6aa100d0\">Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9efef5a3-6fe1-4c44-9114-0ec4a8707e67\">Proficiency Bonus.&nbsp;You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a spell.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Rolling1or20\" data-content-chunk-id=\"94cc098a-49fa-4810-b7ea-df2d352a879b\">Rolling 1 or 20</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f2988101-8695-4f0b-b992-81291f1cb53a\">Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"08b9fac5-fbbd-47a7-a799-be363e5fcc96\">If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. This is called a critical hit, which is explained later in this section.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"00d18e39-b487-48cd-bfeb-c7003972267a\">If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC.</p>\n<h3 id=\"UnseenAttackersandTargets\" data-content-chunk-id=\"25c3d9b0-a807-446d-a6e2-518ad27e3bb4\">Unseen Attackers and Targets</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d49da437-9800-4cdb-be60-5c1cc12e45f2\">Combatants often try to escape their foes' notice by hiding, casting the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/invisibility\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2159-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">invisibility</a>&nbsp;spell, or lurking in darkness.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c7a62036-4c31-4a7f-bd29-db5f4a873f8c\">When you attack a target that you can't see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you're guessing the target's location or you're targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn't in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the DM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target's location correctly.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"760a7b7d-7681-4f2c-a356-05594eca1bbd\">When a creature can't see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it.

A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Range\" data-content-chunk-id=\"33ca8b76-4960-4306-9537-4a3d1c2b25e7\">Range</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"23b6e2da-6971-4d2d-96aa-abd42a4574f3\">You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6e179024-0a00-4a3d-b2ec-afb329c57055\">If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can't attack a target beyond this range.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"50172e42-9c85-4310-89d7-32e9e6ca208c\">Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can't attack a target beyond the long range.</p>\n<h4 id=\"RangedAttacksinCloseCombat\" data-content-chunk-id=\"19ad90ac-9e71-4a12-ac55-f0dc31d520c6\">Ranged Attacks in Close Combat</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"634b5afc-2ac3-471e-9788-e80321b281cf\">Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn't&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/7-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">incapacitated</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"MeleeAttacks\" data-content-chunk-id=\"b50af9bc-254b-4ecd-b891-2d7920429988\">Melee Attacks</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"dd727a1c-8c1f-4da0-8d74-ebb65d76b22b\">Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c7d53a02-d6ce-44b1-9bc5-2f55b1a1c2d7\">Most creatures have a 5-foot&nbsp;reach&nbsp;and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"fc23b45b-79ef-449f-90be-5eae5f4e5bbc\">Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an&nbsp;unarmed strike: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. You are proficient with your unarmed strikes.</p>\n<h4 id=\"OpportunityAttacks\" data-content-chunk-id=\"4e1b3d6b-de54-4429-aec1-dafe82cd002c\">Opportunity Attacks</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0a48fb2a-9ab6-4cba-997f-15869d5bc031\">In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is called an opportunity attack.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e81b547c-6998-47e4-a08c-225f9684e8a1\">You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ad51c223-924b-4664-beaa-2e76b60bbb7e\">You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don't provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don't provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe's reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.</p>\n<h4 id=\"TwoWeaponFighting\" data-content-chunk-id=\"ef6ab0d6-1773-4262-868c-b7741c416ea0\">Two-Weapon Fighting</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9e03cf21-ca78-48cf-8bd0-3befb4c326a9\">When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you're holding in the other hand. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6af71df8-ef91-4146-a8f1-a99c2ca01e75\">If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.</p>\n<blockquote data-content-chunk-id=\"9adaead5-c13b-4447-bc3f-15fb82f6771a\">\n<h4 id=\"ContestsinCombat\" data-content-chunk-id=\"676f7ad0-9a39-4ca7-8abb-765ad0d7dac7\">CONTESTS IN COMBAT</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"87729739-4b89-4850-9fee-891993150235\">Battle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This section includes the most common contests that require an action in combat: grappling and shoving a creature. The DM can use these contests as models for improvising others.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"Grappling\" data-content-chunk-id=\"9c89b168-6cc2-4676-9c55-242855dbb5a2\">Grappling</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5242445d-e04b-437b-b1c4-4fef6622c350\">When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"55b5838a-271d-4cb3-b971-9769a49a921c\">The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach.

The spell brings to your mind a brief summary of the significant lore about the thing you named. The lore might consist of current tales, forgotten stories, or even secret lore that has never been widely known. If the thing you named isn&rsquo;t of legendary importance, you gain no information.

The half-orc nearby shouts orders, helping the two combatants coordinate their assault to the best advantage.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4cf9553c-412c-4ffe-8abd-b9d6bf2e66fa\">A dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between the ogre&rsquo;s club and his companion, knocking the deadly blow aside.

Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit kings &mdash; as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat.

Every fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.</p>\n<h3 id=\"TrainedforDanger\" data-content-chunk-id=\"4a75280a-e2a3-4465-911f-6001962d81ab\">Trained for Danger</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ac77ad26-53a6-4695-8713-74e5af9d57b8\">Not every member of the city watch, the village militia, or the queen&rsquo;s army is a fighter.

Were you particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication? What drove you to this training in the first place? A threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove yourself might all have been factors.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6d7592ce-2a88-46b4-b35f-d78a802dffde\">You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble&rsquo;s army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history. Or you might be self-taught &mdash; unpolished but well tested. Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? They might have been military issue or family heirlooms, or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years to buy them. Your armaments are now among your most important possessions &mdash; the only things that stand between you and death&rsquo;s embrace.</p>\n<h4 id=\"QuickBuild\" data-content-chunk-id=\"9cf7ed3e-2918-4c03-a0fc-681433e92cc3\">Quick Build</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e9afe5c8-71a8-4bd8-aa06-935274246de0\">You can make a fighter quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on whether you want to focus on melee weapons or on archery (or finesse weapons). Your next-highest score should be Constitution, or Intelligence if you plan to adopt the Eldritch Knight martial archetype. Second, choose the soldier background.</p>\n<div>\n<table data-content-chunk-id=\"e1f70e5e-c4bb-40fe-8aef-aeccbe87cf05\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>\n<p>Level</p>\n</th>\n<th>\n<p>Proficiency<br

Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good-aligned gods who created these races gave them free will to choose their moral paths, knowing that good without free will is slavery.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2c7ecd45-5705-4864-bcb9-a372f53fb3bd\">The evil deities who created other races, though, made those races to serve them. Those races have strong inborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods. Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc gods, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an orc chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its innate tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-orcs feel the lingering pull of the orc god&rsquo;s influence.)</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9aac64d6-c7b4-4c0f-b950-838050640d3d\">Alignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends. A devil does not choose to be lawful evil, and it doesn&rsquo;t tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow ceased to be lawful evil, it would cease to be a devil.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1b7dbb4c-dec1-4051-99fc-258d0fd10d5b\">Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments&mdash;they are&nbsp;unaligned. Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil; they have no alignment.</p>\n<blockquote data-content-chunk-id=\"a7c09096-9cac-484e-908d-d94ff1b062e9\">\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ae38c5b4-936c-459d-a786-6c9a5854ae9b\">TIKA AND ARTEMIS: ALIGNMENT</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"19130fb5-547c-4641-bab2-bdb3e24fae11\">Tika Waylan is neutral good, fundamentally good-hearted and striving to help others where she can. Artemis is lawful evil, unconcerned with the value of sentient life but at least professional in his approach to murder.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2345db90-6cf8-4004-984e-d0912111ffae\">As an evil character, Artemis is not an ideal adventurer. He began his career as a villain, and only cooperates with heroes when he must&mdash;and when it&rsquo;s in his own best interests. In most games, evil adventurers cause problems in groups alongside others who don&rsquo;t share their interests and objectives. Generally, evil alignments are for villains and monsters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>","_id":"9iMw3Oy8AsKr9a65"}

In casting a spell, a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic suffusing the world, pins them in place in a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then releases them to unleash the desired effect--in most cases, all in the span of seconds.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"91c1d875-88da-4b06-965d-41df7a609e36\">Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions, drain life energy away, and restore life to the dead.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e58509c5-5194-42bc-802a-dcfcfed80633\">Uncounted thousands of spells have been created over the course of the multiverse's history, and many of them are long forgotten. Some might yet lie recorded in crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped in the minds of dead gods.

A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"bb23e281-956c-44ad-8953-1d7ffef8e8a8\">Ball Bearings.&nbsp;As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level, square area that is 10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/12-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">prone</a>. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the save.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e76503b2-0e28-442b-a56c-b53402b286f8\">Block and Tackle.&nbsp;A set of pulleys with a cable threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the weight you can normally lift.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5e021d48-3292-4000-9712-471e41f92547\">Book.&nbsp;A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook (described later in this section).</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8565bf0c-89cc-4a12-992e-11f28c97d99e\">Caltrops.&nbsp;As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature's walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the save.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1e048d40-e809-4914-93e1-bf8f65a00b9e\">Candle.&nbsp;For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f3aac112-6f6e-415a-8eda-f9afbfc3bcfd\">Case, Crossbow Bolt.&nbsp;This wooden case can hold up to twenty crossbow bolts.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"561795eb-5a05-468d-9c0a-3429bb2bb6e7\">Case, Map or Scroll.&nbsp;This cylindrical leather case can hold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up sheets of parchment.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"80e3b4e2-2e33-4094-bc5d-3e35be8a2e0d\">Chain.&nbsp;A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength check.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"607a7fd6-35a0-461b-ad95-6272662164de\">Climber's Kit.&nbsp;A climber's kit includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber's kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can't fall more than 25 feet from the point where you anchored yourself, and you can't climb more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2eb11dcc-a7d5-4615-9124-4c0c992a9950\">Component Pouch.&nbsp;A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold all the material components and other special items you need to cast your spells, except for those components that have a specific cost (as indicated in a spell's description).</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"967edeac-7181-458e-97ab-1d210e0d9603\">Crowbar.&nbsp;Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength checks where the crowbar's leverage can be applied.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"931cd359-751c-47e5-ab67-9f9428c34760\">Druidic Focus.&nbsp;A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living tree, or a totem object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals. A druid can use such an object as a spellcasting focus.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"70c27d96-d779-4b0c-ab50-cd54f3d4ae21\">Fishing Tackle.&nbsp;This kit includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and narrow netting.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e1ed8447-bd32-4cae-b6a2-ddfb8771d64f\">Healer's Kit.&nbsp;This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Medicine\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/13-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Medicine</a>) check.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"744f0605-bd62-4bb2-9112-4424ea46b8e7\">Holy Symbol.&nbsp;A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. A cleric or paladin can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d076bf91-26a5-4425-ba43-b569ed680a00\">Holy Water.&nbsp;As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0b2fd7e3-b93b-4543-bc71-0744350397b1\">A cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1305a3d7-d2b8-42b7-8a5b-acc9a054129f\">Hunting Trap.&nbsp;When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"39a564dd-c5dd-4437-a169-3894f0493918\">Lamp.&nbsp;A lamp casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b3b58c08-8e53-4e96-8bfe-09b7ee1393c9\">Lantern, Bullseye.&nbsp;A bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"93d59a8e-99e6-4258-9454-8785f3990c52\">Lantern, Hooded.&nbsp;A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2412c885-74e9-42dd-be05-31e99e74fe45\">Lock.&nbsp;A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves' tools can pick this lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Your DM may decide that better locks are available for higher prices.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4733a000-c289-47cb-96ac-28adb7339bc7\">Magnifying Glass.&nbsp;This lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire to ignite. A magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability check made to appraise or inspect an item that is small or highly detailed.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"86c418ed-feca-457e-b75f-a159e73a0d19\">Manacles.&nbsp;These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves' tools can pick the manacles' lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Manacles have 15 hit points.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"06a41043-cbd3-4040-acdf-f36dbcb86fa9\">Mess Kit.&nbsp;This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"085827f7-b8cd-4d37-8e7f-df2e3d865213\">Oil.&nbsp;Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"cd8c95b7-fd17-476b-8a7c-b0642420174a\">Poison, Basic.&nbsp;You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"34077d64-44cc-4c41-96e6-b95832ce0e1b\">Potion of Healing.&nbsp;A character who drinks the magical red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering a potion takes an action.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4177dcca-83dd-49ab-8efb-f02084a7c6b9\">Pouch.&nbsp;A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling bullets or 50 blowgun needles, among other things. A compartmentalized pouch for holding spell components is called a component pouch (described earlier in this section).</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5fe43f36-df74-4f0c-a728-56d98d869e74\">Quiver.&nbsp;A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c3027c8c-9356-40ff-9f0e-1a3281ff50cd\">Ram, Portable.&nbsp;You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4b9a784e-1a46-4f66-b31d-3885d2586e9e\">Rations.&nbsp;Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d7bed069-2c35-4b79-9433-7e9548a0a738\">Rope.&nbsp;Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"27451412-1a43-4bf0-9a6c-0403b255ced6\">Scale, Merchant's.&nbsp;A scale includes a small balance, pans, and a suitable assortment of weights up to 2 pounds. With it, you can measure the exact weight of small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade goods, to help determine their worth.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"684ae8dc-95e7-48e0-a889-99a868eb12c7\">Spellbook.&nbsp;Essential for wizards, a spellbook is a leather-bound tome with 100 blank vellum pages suitable for recording spells.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"72c09900-4b81-40d9-93c4-cae01f292712\">Spyglass.&nbsp;Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"bb46fc5b-71a3-4dc6-984f-5fef5de5e892\">Tent.&nbsp;A simple and portable canvas shelter, a tent sleeps two.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"66aad1b7-7e94-466e-8b50-fe71c3b067f2\">Tinderbox.&nbsp;This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch--or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel--takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c5ae2a5b-b101-4961-9db8-3c5187b278f4\">Torch.&nbsp;A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ContainerCapacity\" data-content-chunk-id=\"40ba046d-c16b-4a32-9583-1430cdfa0416\">Container Capacity</h3>\n<div>\n<table data-content-chunk-id=\"cc5e1b01-3d21-47a8-8ec7-783a0011b9b3\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Container</th>\n<th>Capacity</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Backpack*</td>\n<td>1 cubic foot/30 pounds of gear</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Barrel</td>\n<td>40 gallons liquid, 4 cubic feet solid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Basket</td>\n<td>2 cubic feet/40 pounds of gear</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bottle</td>\n<td>1 1/2 pints liquid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bucket</td>\n<td>3 gallons liquid, 1/2 cubic foot solid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Chest</td>\n<td>12 cubic feet/300 pounds gear</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Flask or tankard</td>\n<td>1 pint liquid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jug or pitcher</td>\n<td>1 gallon liquid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pot, iron</td>\n<td>1 gallon liquid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pouch</td>\n<td>1/5 cubic foot/6 pounds of gear</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sack</td>\n<td>1 cubic foot/30 pounds of gear</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Vial</td>\n<td>4 ounces liquid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Waterskin</td>\n<td>4 pints liquid</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"55361a49-cb6d-4c5b-8c3b-ea45b5b80259\"><br />* You can also strap items, such as a bedroll or a coil of rope, to the outside of a backpack.</p>","_id":"BWBIEpx0uoR9iDSB"}

Divine radiance shines from her hands, the man&rsquo;s wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide with amazement.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"32e456fb-c583-4dcb-9fe5-97af39d2ab47\">A dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches an orc war band celebrating its recent victory. Silently, he stalks into their midst and whispers an oath, and two orcs are dead before they even realize he is there.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1872cbdd-0d35-429f-b8c6-8e7da88cb155\">Silver hair shining in a shaft of light that seems to illuminate only him, an elf laughs with exultation.

Whether sworn before a god&rsquo;s altar and the witness of a priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a paladin&rsquo;s oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.</p>\n<h3 id=\"TheCauseofRighteousness\" data-content-chunk-id=\"79b0e3a4-940f-4183-b556-5a31ff4b4fb3\">The Cause of Righteousness</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"673c5189-daa5-462a-8e47-2bd96d9ffb20\">A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to stand with the good things of the world against the encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are bound by the oaths that grant them power to do their sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to gods of good, a paladin&rsquo;s power comes as much from a commitment to justice itself as it does from a god.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1cdc2d96-a417-40a1-97b0-d301b3a78d37\">Paladins train for years to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent and those who join them in the fight for justice.</p>\n<h3 id=\"BeyondtheMundaneLife\" data-content-chunk-id=\"264b3e65-f92e-47f6-9e87-146674102eb3\">Beyond the Mundane Life</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6da1ee45-5645-4795-9539-a8622a9a01b3\"><a href=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/702/c3paladin1.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/702/300/243/c3paladin1.png\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2b9f77de-0f18-4099-b55f-6cb7d9566ae9\">Almost by definition, the life of a paladin is an adventuring life. Unless a lasting injury has taken him or her away from adventuring for a time, every paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against evil. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the militias and armies of the world, but even fewer people can claim the true calling of a paladin. When they do receive the call, these warriors turn from their former occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, not to crown and country.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3c0c154e-12dc-4649-9a2a-d1fff5e31df0\">Adventuring paladins take their work seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests, and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the cosmic balance away from oblivion.</p>\n<h3 id=\"CreatingaPaladin\" data-content-chunk-id=\"dfae092d-0158-4965-bd3b-bdbbf8cbf1a1\">Creating a Paladin</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"289547ab-efe4-4878-b778-8d31fbce4e64\">The most important aspect of a paladin character is the nature of his or her holy quest. Although the class features related to your oath don&rsquo;t appear until you reach 3rd level, plan ahead for that choice by reading the oath descriptions at the end of the class. Are you a devoted servant of good, loyal to the gods of justice and honor, a holy knight in shining armor venturing forth to smite evil? Are you a glorious champion of the light, cherishing everything beautiful that stands against the shadow, a knight whose oath descends from traditions older than many of the gods? Or are you an embittered loner sworn to take vengeance on those who have done great evil, sent as an angel of death by the gods or driven by your need for revenge?&nbsp;<a title=\"Gods of the Multiverse\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-b-gods-of-the-multiverse#GodsoftheMultiverse\" data-content-chunk-id=\"85d948be-1706-4c12-91ab-9f2c150e5b0a\">Appendix B</a>&nbsp;lists many deities worshiped by paladins throughout the multiverse, such as Torm, Tyr, Heironeous, Paladine, Kiri-Jolith, Dol Arrah, the Silver Flame, Bahamut, Athena, Re-Horakhty, and Heimdall.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5a0dfabd-8dd4-4d7b-8352-45fb285e6536\">How did you experience your call to serve as a paladin? Did you hear a whisper from an unseen god or angel while you were at prayer? Did another paladin sense the potential within you and decide to train you as a squire? Or did some terrible event &mdash; the destruction of your home, perhaps &mdash; drive you to your quests? Perhaps you stumbled into a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave and found yourself called to protect all such refuges of goodness and beauty. Or you might have known from your earliest memories that the paladin&rsquo;s life was your calling, almost as if you had been sent into the world with that purpose stamped on your soul.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a84b859b-3898-4e94-b8f2-afe345283797\">As guardians against the forces of wickedness, paladins are rarely of any evil alignment. Most of them walk the paths of charity and justice. Consider how your alignment colors the way you pursue your holy quest and the manner in which you conduct yourself before gods and mortals. Your oath and alignment might be in harmony, or your oath might represent standards of behavior that you have not yet attained.</p>\n<h4 id=\"QuickBuild\" data-content-chunk-id=\"53df330a-db0a-4051-b495-472a71c0c1e3\">Quick Build</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"031230bf-4ee0-49a0-8b36-386043219335\">You can make a paladin quickly by following these suggestions.

data-content-chunk-id=\"82a13401-96fe-48a8-acb4-51f98abb502a\">The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hallow\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2135-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">hallow</a>&nbsp;spell.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ad6227f2-80d3-4e67-91a7-cdc0656aa2d6\">You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier.

You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level &times; 5.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"feff44e3-b21f-4a1f-819d-91c0f68d55f7\">As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"bbd3edf1-a018-4bbb-bad5-712b6ae82872\">Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"39f764e2-e62b-485f-ae96-7233b97fc5f9\">This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"PaladinFightingStyle\" data-content-chunk-id=\"d24ab9e7-2311-43b5-9534-9206a04deb9a\">Fighting Style</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7150bfac-60bd-4500-b8b7-8c9b0d1f758b\">At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty.

You can&rsquo;t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Defense\" data-content-chunk-id=\"3ce7aef9-bb36-4ff5-85eb-b68df62c295a\">Defense</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d52cf757-64d2-4c71-bd68-d05c72ee6e52\">While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Dueling\" data-content-chunk-id=\"5aa02acd-3637-4d5b-8fe9-cd720729416a\">Dueling</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"fe2acb47-427d-40dc-85f6-a846399b29e5\">When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p>\n<h4 id=\"GreatWeaponFighting\" data-content-chunk-id=\"6797a282-cf46-48df-9f37-dfe8974d2cc5\">Great Weapon Fighting</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1d31f902-9bbe-4476-8d2c-1c1486a6dc99\">When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Protection\" data-content-chunk-id=\"3f1f56e3-398a-4ead-a66e-0ec6f705074e\">Protection</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c205af86-017b-4079-8a03-0fff7ef8fd8f\">When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.</p>\n<h3 id=\"PaladinSpellcasting\" data-content-chunk-id=\"7a3b9fe8-727e-4f5a-99fb-ada7c04b3fe9\">Spellcasting</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"83f9b852-252e-455d-9906-8ab377b4c25b\">By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See&nbsp;<a title=\"Spellcasting\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\" data-content-chunk-id=\"f260e43c-670a-4485-ba97-13a3d49f5823\">chapter 10</a>&nbsp;for the general rules of spellcasting and&nbsp;<a title=\"Spells\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spells#PaladinSpells\" data-content-chunk-id=\"9591a398-ee30-4a92-96d9-12f5dd251d7a\">chapter 11</a>&nbsp;for the paladin&nbsp;spell list.</p>\n<h4 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" data-content-chunk-id=\"4a5e50f8-a47d-4dd0-a07a-eddbfc09f7f9\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"46f763cb-f62f-4277-a4d2-202bb8c64d9e\">The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell&rsquo;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b243c74d-2474-4a18-87d3-f094eb47802d\">You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d2fb113f-8d99-4dfd-8daa-1afea69fdca2\">For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cure-wounds\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2056-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">cure wounds</a>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&rsquo;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a9021fb7-14f9-4512-830d-52db8bb004f9\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<h4 id=\"SpellcastingAbility\" data-content-chunk-id=\"ee610a6e-1396-4f16-84bd-a8e65fd108ab\">Spellcasting Ability</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"93d0057c-77a0-43c7-9923-a414541409cb\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"833967b1-e39f-4baa-ae00-510d01bfdd13\">Spell save DC&nbsp;= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"af497e00-775d-45c9-835e-db519e1db361\">Spell attack modifier&nbsp;= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<h4 id=\"SpellcastingFocus\" data-content-chunk-id=\"81c7b6a5-3df5-40fa-8ed7-af7d38332764\">Spellcasting Focus</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a9b5d1b6-811e-4ae1-87db-4a142170ed04\">You can use a holy symbol (see chapter 5, &ldquo;<a title=\"Holy Symbol\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#HolySymbol\" data-content-chunk-id=\"692216d7-8980-4987-bb60-988c57faf0ea\">Equipment</a>&rdquo;) as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.</p>\n<h3 id=\"DivineSmite\" data-content-chunk-id=\"b2e0d140-ecb4-48cf-b628-fbaf39341345\">Divine Smite</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a61ba958-b7d9-41fc-9190-42f21e54c0f9\">Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon&rsquo;s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.</p>\n<h3 id=\"DivineHealth\" data-content-chunk-id=\"34b0ed6d-acbb-4acd-bff4-2f92a0b7b36c\">Divine Health</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b98d0179-24d4-45de-af30-512b9ca12c50\">By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.</p>\n<h3 id=\"SacredOath\" data-content-chunk-id=\"ea7ff146-ed4b-49db-8208-73cf9c7a7f18\">Sacred Oath</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"64f34de2-25e7-42ab-bbb2-5e80df0f75a9\">When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion, the Oath of the Ancients, or the Oath of Vengeance, all detailed at the end of the class description.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6b2e868c-7812-47c9-a216-8116579dd704\">Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level.

The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin&rsquo;s training. Some characters with this class don&rsquo;t consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin&rsquo;s heart.</p>\n<blockquote data-content-chunk-id=\"5d4928e5-368b-4f06-9208-bc56630bacdf\">\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"43a03f34-9272-4d25-b15a-fd7b09d64433\">BREAKING YOUR OATH</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b5fb0c92-650f-4603-8815-bc8dc314c593\">A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"736cf9f4-5617-4dac-ba25-22d7219b8d1a\">A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all-night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e3aaf2e3-f40d-4af1-93f2-c397a55c334d\">If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the DM&rsquo;s discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another, or perhaps to take the Oathbreaker paladin option that appears in the&nbsp;Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"OathofDevotion\" data-content-chunk-id=\"0bc54699-711a-47fa-abd8-e565f99f896d\">Oath of Devotion</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3f546ae5-55e1-424b-8e65-cd548b89f592\">The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods&rsquo; tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels &mdash; the perfect servants of good &mdash; as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.</p>\n<h4 id=\"TenetsofDevotion\" data-content-chunk-id=\"39148d56-8515-407d-a3b7-286228d4873c\">Tenets of Devotion</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"50f0a4b7-33ab-4554-bee8-4674780b9f78\">Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5681c19b-d377-4a08-8ac5-d9d7eb830cfd\">Honesty.&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"bf70f997-d8c3-43d5-ac41-ba6e07f12829\">Courage.&nbsp;Never fear to act, though caution is wise.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9c3c0520-f64b-4d91-8423-4c3bbfc37697\">Compassion.&nbsp;Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them.

You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-square panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel.

It has AC 12 and 30 hit points per 10-foot section, and it is vulnerable to fire damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn must make a Constitution saving throw. That creature takes 5d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"547ecce7-8139-4f0f-a178-86d24b5ce90c\">At Higher Levels.&nbsp;When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage the wall deals when it appears increases by 2d6, and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by 1d6, for each slot level above 6th.</p>\n<h3 id=\"WallofStone\" data-content-chunk-id=\"4306af38-170c-4cb3-8689-25f8f580879c\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wall-of-stone\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2294-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Wall of Stone</a></h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2a8f7290-f019-4f80-baa4-7e968a3359de\">5th-level evocation</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8e43e764-5a18-4f57-bb7f-787448d807d8\">Casting Time:&nbsp;1 action</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"bc1f2082-bd92-41e5-90ef-7ea77e95e8b5\">Range:&nbsp;120 feet</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"967f1872-8a89-47cb-b13e-29c334d7a8aa\">Components:&nbsp;V, S, M (a small block of granite)</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f0574f9d-67a9-4e88-977e-338e7171707b\">Duration:&nbsp;Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"dcfba795-b204-42eb-9053-8ebe8bada76a\">A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4c5c2434-183d-4308-8448-803fa3cfb2e7\">If the wall cuts through a creature&rsquo;s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7fb0b63a-bfd5-45fa-94dc-68452249a3ed\">The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can&rsquo;t occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn&rsquo;t need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"509e4346-e307-47be-a06b-fc5e35b0971d\">If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b878fba0-9c02-44e9-add3-ac0592e57928\">The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM&rsquo;s discretion.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d31e665d-4c04-4faf-a8c8-6ae5f96e7cfd\">If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can&rsquo;t be dispelled.

The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"54eab972-650a-4aa2-b93e-c1ffcb7c9223\">When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw.

For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d8 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f73b5805-af68-476e-9516-3ba496eff25b\">At Higher Levels.&nbsp;When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, both types of damage increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.</p>\n<h3 id=\"WardingBond\" data-content-chunk-id=\"ed217296-99d4-4bb9-a180-bf834d268354\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/warding-bond\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2296-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Warding Bond</a></h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"60a9ba44-89d6-418d-87b4-ce7906dc30b3\">2nd-level abjuration</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"33dfab20-ce6a-484b-928c-716dcbb51443\">Casting Time:&nbsp;1 action</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5b4d2891-c3ca-4cc9-8c5a-bb50466853e6\">Range:&nbsp;Touch</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e629b716-0256-45f1-b9d6-8a534aed9588\">Components:&nbsp;V, S, M (a pair of platinum rings worth at least 50 gp each, which you and the target must wear for the duration)</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"439bcadc-7a13-41e4-94f7-cefc3b3c51c9\">Duration:&nbsp;1 hour</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7bfe53f6-c9a0-49f4-8acb-96165dfb9827\">This spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates a mystic connection between you and the target until the spell ends.

If it can&rsquo;t land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"WindWall\" data-content-chunk-id=\"5521275f-4eb4-4a42-8dd6-862cb1b45f6c\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wind-wall\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2302-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Wind Wall</a></h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"95d39c6a-875d-424d-baaa-6c0fc92ff9a3\">3rd-level evocation</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"813caaf6-a7d0-404a-b3ba-96decc576d96\">Casting Time:&nbsp;1 action</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7b44bee2-fdd9-40ff-880d-40dbc8fb7d2f\">Range:&nbsp;120 feet</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"65de0599-3c43-4aae-911c-1ff1e6135452\">Components:&nbsp;V, S, M (a tiny fan and a feather of exotic origin)</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"90aff1e6-51e3-47bb-a6e6-31352a1fe9fd\">Duration:&nbsp;Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"812159b7-6a08-4002-842a-b34268daf648\">A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the duration.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3a409b13-02a3-44fa-9e81-0c5af20db0b1\">When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"743f89f6-e4b1-4e90-9069-f8905abbe9a3\">The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects can&rsquo;t pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss. (Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures in gaseous form can&rsquo;t pass through it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Wish\" data-content-chunk-id=\"27127f32-7eb8-433c-8523-73bcc4200aa7\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wish\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2303-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Wish</a></h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"448d9c46-a7c5-4ef6-9209-48ba43758593\">9th-level conjuration</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b978e89e-f58c-493e-bf27-c3da8fcb609b\">Casting Time:&nbsp;1 action</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"eeadfbdf-4a32-4615-8027-6c2d41b4c704\">Range:&nbsp;Self</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"727753b0-5ed1-4075-b3b6-43b75e087e2c\">Components:&nbsp;V</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a41368a1-ea59-46d1-b2dc-e76e07ec4c0d\">Duration:&nbsp;Instantaneous</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0f875adb-4289-4d6a-a3b2-069adfc568e8\">Wish&nbsp;is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1f6931ae-850b-4e82-b5b9-9f91c3496e88\">The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don&rsquo;t need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c2daf62f-e2ae-4502-a024-411a66e09a87\">Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:</p>\n<ul data-content-chunk-id=\"21640357-efa4-4d07-aadc-8337d2d186d6\">\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"d0bd217f-29af-4410-b4a9-64348b27ad1a\">You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn&rsquo;t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.</li>\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"4218e7e8-6c2f-464f-b0bb-f0f65b7c1068\">You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/greater-restoration\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2129-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">greater restoration</a>&nbsp;spell.</li>\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"fc39ec2f-ffa0-484b-b0ef-efca3c91d9e1\">You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.</li>\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"e0089c90-5ad2-4a73-ac56-05d9e5f58c15\">You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich&rsquo;s life drain attack.</li>\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"e7c4819e-4bed-48bc-b7dd-3d922b171cce\">You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a&nbsp;wish&nbsp;spell could undo an opponent&rsquo;s successful save, a foe&rsquo;s critical hit, or a friend&rsquo;s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d33960c9-1d53-4165-a539-ece3cd48d8b7\">You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item&rsquo;s current owner.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f03a3333-078b-4eb3-b00c-9298a2707ac5\">The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can&rsquo;t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn&rsquo;t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast&nbsp;wish&nbsp;ever again if you suffer this stress.</p>\n<h3 id=\"WordofRecall\" data-content-chunk-id=\"ba0ac137-9878-4961-8237-dfca80f5da13\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/word-of-recall\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2304-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Word of Recall</a></h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"df621168-ab1c-4eec-9b4a-c8d77139e2af\">6th-level conjuration</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"581571fe-0910-4f2f-9259-b56d351ba95e\">Casting Time:&nbsp;1 action</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"07623c61-f3bb-4761-8ace-5ab02b6990bf\">Range:&nbsp;5 feet</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ece15537-f943-4724-b47c-b0629066b65b\">Components:&nbsp;V</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"34c70b6a-a950-422a-880c-050fde04a0e4\">Duration:&nbsp;Instantaneous</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"566fa471-c131-4ff3-9281-6422b439a2eb\">You and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet of you instantly teleport to a previously designated sanctuary. You and any creatures that teleport with you appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the spot you designated when you prepared your sanctuary (see below).

When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw.

The door is large enough to allow Medium creatures to pass through unhindered. When opened, the door leads to a demiplane that appears to be an empty room 30 feet in each dimension, made of wood or stone.

When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn&rsquo;t speak any language, the creature is unaffected.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"369b9abf-74a9-4572-933d-d862936bd6e4\">You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature&mdash;what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature&rsquo;s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature&rsquo;s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature&rsquo;s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b48719da-b759-4cda-80e3-dbba12e19a72\">Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b054bd41-fe92-4146-bec3-b5b8755ac616\">You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can&rsquo;t see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can&rsquo;t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn&rsquo;t speak any language.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"cde8ee21-a30a-45a6-a458-3ca885b5fd40\">Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can&rsquo;t see it, but it must still be within range.</p>\n<h3 id=\"DimensionDoor\" data-content-chunk-id=\"a41a30ca-5e01-4409-9a64-c22252a9f36d\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dimension-door\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2068-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Dimension Door</a></h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"24a9c9ac-8056-4687-904d-de57ab4f48ed\"><a href=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/759/c114.jpg\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/759/400/531/c114.jpg\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e0231059-d9d6-48e5-a9ee-c5fbb5e75f99\">4th-level conjuration</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3cad200d-b85b-42e5-b81b-f311d346a4ed\">Casting Time:&nbsp;1 action</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"227a2d51-d9ad-4def-8a67-2dcd59e36018\">Range:&nbsp;500 feet</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2b2c6d59-3133-4ab7-adab-a7cce0a823d2\">Components:&nbsp;V</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"935d278b-5496-4094-aa7a-80e2eed5d670\">Duration:&nbsp;Instantaneous</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7d52c8ba-4df9-472c-af23-292d437f15e7\">You teleport yourself from your current location to any other spot within range.

You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can&rsquo;t change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b4e20771-ab77-480a-89af-c01a1216f0b1\">The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"da091132-8682-44d9-aac7-0cc59d8c7719\">To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Investigation\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/8-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Investigation</a>) check against your spell save DC.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Disintegrate\" data-content-chunk-id=\"91e810fc-da31-4dc2-b250-eaf6a871c0ac\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/disintegrate\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2070-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Disintegrate</a></h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e957bede-9561-4280-988f-52905c0b868c\">6th-level transmutation</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f8703edf-96c0-442f-a4e1-7098fdc4db8b\">Casting Time:&nbsp;1 action</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3498e361-b39b-4744-8655-41d5a6e93772\">Range:&nbsp;60 feet</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6ada835c-fbdc-4637-a80a-530548ae29e4\">Components:&nbsp;V, S, M (a lodestone and a pinch of dust)</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"96c5d859-43a3-433e-b11c-c9afcb7f0062\">Duration:&nbsp;Instantaneous</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"64b9b088-2f96-42a7-b286-9e9dbcb0310d\">A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target that you can see within range.

Choose a creature known to you as the target of this spell. The target must be on the same plane of existence as you. Creatures that don&rsquo;t sleep, such as elves, can&rsquo;t be contacted by this spell. You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a trance state, acting as a messenger.

The messenger can also shape the environment of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the target&rsquo;s dreams.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ed78d3cd-b42a-49da-a938-5de5b3871334\">You can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the target.

Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to the magic used to create it. In any case, the item behaves like a character, complete with personality quirks, ideals, bonds, and sometimes flaws. A sentient item might be a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in the side.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"aa250ed7-b17b-4301-978d-bd9f3f0e34bc\">Most sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of items can manifest sentience, but consumable items such as potions and scrolls are never sentient.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"eef66e36-ebcc-40bb-8108-6134953d573a\">Sentient magic items function as NPCs under the DM's control. Any activated property of the item is under the item's control, not its wielder's. As long as the wielder maintains a good relationship with the item, the wielder can access those properties normally. If the relationship is strained, the item can suppress its activated properties or even turn them against the wielder.</p>\n<h3 id=\"CreatingSentientMagicItems\" data-content-chunk-id=\"2920159e-e9db-4dfb-a048-ca9298b979dc\">Creating Sentient Magic Items</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1795f7dd-57ed-444c-a704-c9c9258d021e\">When you decide to make a magic item sentient, you create the item's persona in the same way you would create an NPC, with a few exceptions described here.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Abilities\" data-content-chunk-id=\"5ebce9b2-21d5-4081-863b-c570d0587d78\">Abilities</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5649b4e9-a608-400a-a0c7-8de86b59ca9a\">A sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You can choose the item's abilities or determine them randomly. To determine them randomly, roll 4d6 for each one, dropping the lowest roll and totaling the rest.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Communication\" data-content-chunk-id=\"8abc9a87-d77d-46ea-80fd-00c37551c134\">Communication</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"adaa177f-f523-4407-b322-951204b0d7c6\">A sentient item has some ability to communicate, either by sharing its emotions, broadcasting its thoughts telepathically, or speaking aloud.

Its creator or nature might suggest an alignment. If not, you can pick an alignment or roll on the following table.</p>\n<div>\n<table id=\"sentientalignment\" data-content-chunk-id=\"becb3be2-bbb6-4d21-a29e-59e825b3bd77\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>d100</th>\n<th>Alignment</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>01-15</td>\n<td>Lawful good</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16-35</td>\n<td>Neutral good</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>36-50</td>\n<td>Chaotic good</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>51-63</td>\n<td>Lawful neutral</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>64-73</td>\n<td>Neutral</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>74-85</td>\n<td>Chaotic neutral</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>86-89</td>\n<td>Lawful evil</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>90-96</td>\n<td>Neutral evil</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>97-00</td>\n<td>Chaotic evil</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"SpecialPurpose\" data-content-chunk-id=\"0f27e590-d46f-44cc-a448-931c5a05745f\">Special Purpose</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"81f0cdbd-e728-43c8-a5fe-1f003593f456\">You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues, perhaps to the exclusion of all else. As long as the wielder's use of the item aligns with that special purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating from this course might cause conflict between the wielder and the item, and could even cause the item to prevent the use of its activated properties. You can pick a special purpose or roll on the following table.</p>\n<div>\n<table data-content-chunk-id=\"e703b26f-75fe-4fec-b050-36e070edaf56\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>d10</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Aligned: The item seeks to defeat or destroy those of a diametrically opposed alignment.

If its wielder acts in a manner opposed to the item's alignment or purpose, conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item makes a Charisma check contested by the wielder's Charisma check. If the item wins the contest, it makes one or more of the following demands:</p>\n<ul data-content-chunk-id=\"d2bfe8e5-141a-4630-89ad-a42581051616\">\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"0bb351af-7573-488e-b2d0-37798c6319df\">The item insists on being carried or worn at all times.</li>\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"1161f8fb-bac8-4c16-ba60-ca86ae59b839\">The item demands that its wielder dispose of anything the item finds repugnant.</li>\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"e0abbf68-0d4f-42b3-add0-0bfa1aaf6707\">The item demands that its wielder pursue the item's goals to the exclusion of all other goals.</li>\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"26bdbe0f-6840-4861-9cfa-3fbfc9ba69b9\">The item demands to be given to someone else.</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"276ba438-6edc-40f6-8ca6-9394e488e038\">If its wielder refuses to comply with the item's wishes, the item can do any or all of the following:</p>\n<ul data-content-chunk-id=\"8c29497c-97e8-4e4e-8b7f-b0c2486c5902\">\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"3220ba7c-8352-45dd-80d1-46a56937a276\">Make it impossible for its wielder to attune to it.</li>\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"0e956a5e-ffff-4ad0-b5b1-bfb2f54e16c5\">Suppress one or more of its activated properties.</li>\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"fab0effe-1f92-45de-9b4d-f3a0a2c60f14\">Attempt to take control of its wielder.</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"78a1c91d-d0c3-451b-8858-1967db9b2fba\">If a sentient item attempts to take control of its wielder, the wielder must make a Charisma saving throw, with a DC equal to 12 + the item's Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the wielder is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/2-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">charmed</a>&nbsp;by the item for 1d12 hours.

The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell level, doesn't expend any of the user's spell slots, and requires no components, unless the item's description says otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, and the user of the item must concentrate if the spell requires concentration. Many items, such as potions, bypass the casting of a spell and confer the spell's effects, with their usual duration. Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"bef7fe35-e2d7-484d-894d-70255fcaa07e\">A magic item, such as certain staffs, may require you to use your own spellcasting ability when you cast a spell from the item. If you have more than one spellcasting ability, you choose which one to use with the item. If you don't have a spellcasting ability -- perhaps you're a rogue with the Use Magic Device feature -- your spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and your proficiency bonus does apply.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Charges\" data-content-chunk-id=\"8b31bc33-df65-46f1-8f59-d2c3579a377a\">Charges</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f4725cfd-4fe9-4d49-93a6-a084e3dce57a\">Some magic items have charges that must be expended to activate their properties.

She whirls among them, knocking their blows aside and sending them reeling, until at last she stands alone.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"15924bb5-6f7e-46d0-af9e-c5e7e1f60647\">Taking a deep breath, a human covered in tattoos settles into a battle stance.

She slides her blade free of its cloth-wrapped scabbard and peers through the open window at the tyrant prince, so vulnerable in the grip of sleep.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"217ea6f3-c754-4392-94ad-6fbf1f28f6c9\">Whatever their discipline, monks are united in their ability to magically harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.</p>\n<h3 id=\"TheMagicofKi\" data-content-chunk-id=\"eb909bc3-db8a-468c-ab90-b84a2314c438\">The Magic of Ki</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b1d9b445-b205-4d21-adec-88a109b511df\">Monks make careful study of a magical energy that most monastic traditions call&nbsp;ki. This energy is an element of the magic that suffuses the multiverse &mdash; specifically, the element that flows through living bodies. Monks harness this power within themselves to create magical effects and exceed their bodies&rsquo; physical capabilities, and some of their special attacks can hinder the flow of ki in their opponents. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes. As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of ki gives them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"TrainingandAsceticism\" data-content-chunk-id=\"e11a127e-ac7a-424e-b3ee-fcfa63788130\">Training and Asceticism</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"16d08eb8-f4c1-49d3-b3c4-1afed988728f\"><a href=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/699/c3monk1.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/699/300/250/c3monk1.png\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2f57eabb-4d2d-4d4f-a70c-7249edb279fd\">Small walled cloisters dot the landscapes of the worlds of D&amp;D, tiny refuges from the flow of ordinary life, where time seems to stand still. The monks who live there seek personal perfection through contemplation and rigorous training. Many entered the monastery as children, sent to live there when their parents died, when food couldn&rsquo;t be found to support them, or in return for some kindness that the monks had performed for their families.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d1309757-885d-4a7f-be29-36e3c5c641ae\">Some monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that might impede their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the command of their leader, a noble patron, or some other mortal or divine power.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2796b0f6-71ff-473c-abaf-a6a5b3a79d0d\">The majority of monks don&rsquo;t shun their neighbors, making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and exchanging their service for food and other goods. As versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting their neighbors from monsters or tyrants.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e5fa6d78-3505-4a73-b895-0c338dc6fb6b\">For a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving a structured, communal lifestyle to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, and monks don&rsquo;t undertake it lightly. Those who leave their cloisters take their work seriously, approaching their adventures as personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth. As a rule, monks care little for material wealth and are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering their treasure.</p>\n<h3 id=\"CreatingaMonk\" data-content-chunk-id=\"ea9ac1cc-79cd-48fd-8cfe-68b54765e66b\">Creating a Monk</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"81894c73-f745-4afb-adf8-03c231b33d77\">As you make your monk character, think about your connection to the monastery where you learned your skills and spent your formative years. Were you an orphan or a child left on the monastery&rsquo;s threshold? Did your parents promise you to the monastery in gratitude for a service performed by the monks? Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed? Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself?</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"78e66b0f-756b-4373-b018-6a8114f050c6\">Consider why you left. Did the head of your monastery choose you for a particularly important mission beyond the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of some violation of the community&rsquo;s rules. Did you dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something you hope to accomplish outside the monastery? Are you eager to return to your home?</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ba20654b-2558-42b9-9ce8-fb64a238a4ab\">As a result of the structured life of a monastic community and the discipline required to harness ki, monks are almost always lawful in alignment.</p>\n<h4 id=\"QuickBuild\" data-content-chunk-id=\"b4e14da0-e4c6-4928-a342-e8ce78ec428b\">Quick Build</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6e41774e-d0ab-4b02-890d-d128e2c44515\">You can make a monk quickly by following these suggestions.

Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk according to his or her aptitude and interest. All three traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"WayoftheOpenHand\" data-content-chunk-id=\"41641d24-bcae-446d-8286-66449a35697b\">Way of the Open Hand</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2b661033-5a7a-415d-91e2-efac961d1648\">Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed.

Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:</p>\n<ul data-content-chunk-id=\"8016de74-ea6e-44c6-895a-2f8d3e525f86\">\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"a6a915ab-1e98-41f1-b5ef-eff695f45400\">It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/12-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">prone</a>.</li>\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"b81475e6-3168-48f2-b55d-1c35c9531f87\">It must make a Strength saving throw.

When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 necrotic damage.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5218eaff-6756-4acc-b3b4-8db162826389\">You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time.

In lands with an Asian cultural flavor, such as Shou Lung far to the east of the Forgotten Realms, these monasteries are associated with philosophical traditions and martial arts practice. The Iron Hand School, the Five Stars School, the Northern Fist School, and the Southern Star School of Shou Lung teach different approaches to the physical, mental, and spiritual disciplines of the monk. Some of these monasteries have spread to the western lands of Faer&ucirc;n, particularly in places with large Shou immigrant communities, such as Thesk and Westgate.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"464ee902-436b-4071-ab38-a328ea93f50b\">Other monastic traditions are associated with deities who teach the value of physical excellence and mental discipline. In the Forgotten Realms, the order of the Dark Moon is made up of monks dedicated to Shar (goddess of loss), who maintain secret communities in remote hills, back allies, and subterranean hideaways. Monasteries of Ilmater (god of endurance) are named after flowers, and their orders carry the names of great heroes of the faith; the Disciples of Saint Sollars the Twice-Martyred reside in the Monastery of the Yellow Rose near Damara. The monasteries of Eberron combine the study of martial arts with a life of scholarship. Most are devoted to the deities of the Sovereign Host. In the world of Dragonlance, most monks are devoted to Majere, god of meditation and thought. In Greyhawk, many monasteries are dedicated to Xan Yae, the goddess of twilight and the superiority of mind over matter, or to Zuoken, god of mental and physical mastery.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6003f73b-ce72-49fc-bae5-275a7351292c\">The evil monks of the Scarlet Brotherhood in the world of Greyhawk derive their fanatic zeal not from devotion to a god but from dedication to the principles of their nation and their race&mdash;the belief that the Suel strand of humanity are meant to rule the world.</p>\n</blockquote>","_id":"EUg1ikOqONAQ9T9h"}

Your character in the game might explore forgotten ruins and uncharted lands, uncover dark secrets and sinister plots, and slay foul monsters. And if all goes well, your character will survive to claim rich rewards before embarking on a new adventure.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2841d6bf-ac46-4fbf-8a80-7a33f2c6cefd\">This section covers the basics of the adventuring life, from the mechanics of movement to the complexities of social interaction. The rules for resting are also in this section, along with a discussion of the activities your character might pursue between adventures.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"45a38667-6c88-4ae9-8317-ec9e00152615\">Whether adventurers are exploring a dusty dungeon or the complex relationships of a royal court, the game follows a natural rhythm, as outlined in the book&rsquo;s introduction:</p>\n<ol data-content-chunk-id=\"4cef0ab2-c4b2-4d21-b39c-02190735f7df\">\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"78d1299a-9b81-4611-9be6-2be48bf497b1\">The DM describes the environment.</li>\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"a4a76120-98d5-4e1c-b4b1-df7d6f458a6b\">The players describe what they want to do.</li>\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"f6751a46-81b9-4743-b15d-262d240d1e27\">The DM narrates the results of their actions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"85a215bb-4641-4afd-a2aa-42dbf4fb9993\">Typically, the DM uses a map as an outline of the adventure, tracking the characters&rsquo; progress as they explore dungeon corridors or wilderness regions. The DM&rsquo;s notes, including a key to the map, describe what the adventurers find as they enter each new area. Sometimes, the passage of time and the adventurers&rsquo; actions determine what happens, so the DM might use a timeline or a flowchart to track their progress instead of a map.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Time\" data-content-chunk-id=\"7b33f259-43f4-40a6-9b29-87a75193441c\">Time</h2>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5b909704-c7fb-424d-ac9f-74d3d3790d09\">In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the DM determines the time a task requires. The DM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In a dungeon environment, the adventurers' movement happens on a scale of&nbsp;minutes. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"333c187e-58e9-4dce-8939-cbaec2fc93f6\">In a city or wilderness, a scale of&nbsp;hours&nbsp;is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours' time.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"fa9d5949-0e5b-41eb-afd6-6eb0ea97a31f\">For long journeys, a scale of&nbsp;days&nbsp;works best. Following the road from Baldur's Gate to Waterdeep, the adventurers spend four uneventful days before a goblin ambush interrupts their journey.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"eb4bf8f7-e74a-4da3-8096-34fbaf325a08\">In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on&nbsp;rounds, a 6-second span of time.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"185d3f6a-386b-4e86-9ee3-89d9a9d6a851\"><a href=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/725/c55.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/725/850/641/c55.png\" /></a></p>","_id":"FPxWa0Lv513nizCR"}

The day&rsquo;s march had been difficult, but the reward at the end was beyond their dreams.&nbsp;The companions stood on a high cliff over the fabled&nbsp;city&nbsp;of Qualinost.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5bed9d08-abe0-4f03-b801-a2824734c564\">Four slender spires rose from the city&rsquo;s corners like glistening spindles, their brilliant white stone marbled with shining silver. Graceful arches, swooping from spire to spire, soared through the air. Crafted by ancient dwarven metalsmiths, they were strong enough to hold the weight of an army, yet they appeared so delicate that a bird lighting on them might overthrow the balance. These glistening arches were the city&rsquo;s only boundaries; there was no wall around Qualinost. The elven city opened its arms lovingly to the wilderness.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5c077131-bcbc-443e-9ff8-ef4053614ca2\">&mdash; Margaret Weis &amp; Tracy Hickman,&nbsp;Dragons of Autumn Twilight</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"805cebfb-70ef-4be4-81b5-130ae133096a\">Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things&nbsp;of the world.</p>\n<h3 id=\"SlenderandGraceful\" data-content-chunk-id=\"9002d31a-a70a-4142-a23a-6c33cd72cee7\">Slender and Graceful</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4118df2a-e21a-406a-98fb-27ed843b2480\">With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves appear hauntingly beautiful to humans and members of many other races. They are slightly shorter than humans on average, ranging from well under 5 feet tall to just over 6 feet. They are more slender than humans, weighing only 100 to 145 pounds. Males and females are about the same height, and males are only marginally heavier&nbsp;than females.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3bb82a6e-13a1-4f92-bd2c-f3c077a677b5\">Elves&rsquo; coloration encompasses the normal human range and also includes skin in shades of copper, bronze, and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue, and eyes like pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves have no facial and little body hair. They favor elegant clothing in bright colors, and they enjoy simple yet lovely jewelry.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ATimelessPerspective\" data-content-chunk-id=\"57773845-6283-44d3-8ac8-e1fb2f501861\">A Timeless Perspective</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"51d44fef-5885-44e2-829e-f960e5b9835d\"><a href=\"http://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/623/elf1.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\" data-content-chunk-id=\"95a4a4b3-4de0-475b-a988-34cf5cbe50a4\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/623/300/300/elf1.png\" alt=\"\" data-content-chunk-id=\"5c0c012d-0c23-4b9d-90b7-c005c5ca1f32\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"56bd4d19-99a3-411f-aae5-55487a610d1b\">Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the shorter-lived races more deeply. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a4ec09ed-2903-4721-9614-c784d4fb0663\">Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence. They have been known to retreat from intrusions into their woodland homes, confident that they can simply wait the invaders out. But when the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow,&nbsp;and strategy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"HiddenWoodlandRealms\" data-content-chunk-id=\"b7269313-97ab-4810-9862-9ca01359873d\">Hidden Woodland Realms</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9e0fa526-76e4-415c-8623-af24cbe29850\"><a href=\"http://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/624/elf2.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\" data-content-chunk-id=\"35986b1c-20b6-4d86-bf84-8db3137a7162\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/624/300/298/elf2.png\" alt=\"\" data-content-chunk-id=\"08698383-0001-41df-9164-9a54db8ace1b\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a2103389-339f-4472-99f8-75614cd11460\">Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among the trees. Elves hunt game, gather food, and grow vegetables, and their skill and magic allow them to support themselves without the need for clearing and plowing land. They are talented artisans, crafting finely worked clothes and art objects. Their contact with outsiders is usually limited, though a few elves make a good living by trading crafted items for metals (which they have no interest in mining).</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f1e981b3-0c3a-46e0-a63b-df1632b05306\">Elves encountered outside their own lands are commonly traveling minstrels, artists, or sages. Human nobles compete for the services of elf instructors to teach swordplay or magic to their children.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ExplorationandAdventure\" data-content-chunk-id=\"8f276457-ae1e-475d-9f04-f6119fcb2aa8\">Exploration and Adventure</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f08ae93e-fbf0-4661-bc50-b948093064e1\">Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day to day but constantly changing over decades, so they find careers that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and adventuring allows them to do so. Some might join with rebels fighting against oppression, and others might become champions of&nbsp;moral causes.</p>\n<blockquote data-content-chunk-id=\"29923470-31ca-4432-b964-4ce96704243d\">\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4d465e12-20cb-4b51-b57d-c4caa6c8c221\">HAUGHTY BUT GRACIOUS</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"27227a61-fa16-454a-885f-bdc3a5e2173c\">Although they can be haughty, elves are generally gracious even to those who fall short of their high expectations&mdash;which is most non-elves. Still, they can find good in just about anyone.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"776bed02-9079-4ce0-b326-61db65bc5af6\">Dwarves.&nbsp;&ldquo;Dwarves are dull, clumsy oafs. But what they lack in humor, sophistication, and manners, they make up in valor. And I must admit, their best smiths produce art that approaches elven quality.&rdquo;</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"415987f7-5da9-40e0-8386-bc5e3eec09eb\">Halflings.&nbsp;&ldquo;Halflings are people of simple pleasures, and that is not a quality to scorn. They&rsquo;re good folk, they care for each other and tend their gardens, and they have proven themselves tougher than they seem when the need arises.&rdquo;</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7c953410-414c-40c2-af80-51e2ed76573d\">Humans.&nbsp;&ldquo;All that haste, their ambition and drive to accomplish something before their brief lives pass away&mdash;human endeavors seem so futile sometimes. But then you look at what they have accomplished, and you have to appreciate their achievements. If only they could slow down and learn some refinement.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"ElfNames\" data-content-chunk-id=\"d40769d4-4979-4950-b7b7-81a015421323\">Elf Names</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b01be753-de7e-4359-b136-246cd695c8bd\">Elves are considered children until they declare themselves adults, some time after the hundredth birthday, and before this period they are called by&nbsp;child names.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1b139eab-b17b-40af-b4fc-ba312d93fada\">On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name, although those who knew him or her as a youngster might continue to use the child name. Each elf&rsquo;s adult name is a unique creation, though it might reflect the names of respected individuals or other family members. Little distinction exists between male names and female names; the groupings here reflect only general tendencies. In addition, every elf bears a family name, typically a combination of other Elvish words. Some elves traveling among humans translate their family names into Common, but others retain the Elvish version.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0cb12dd0-5fdb-4ba0-bd62-b8242a039541\">Child Names:&nbsp;Ara, Bryn, Del, Eryn, Faen, Innil, Lael, Mella, Naill, Naeris, Phann, Rael, Rinn, Sai, Syllin, Thia, Vall</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0cb472b4-86b6-431e-a226-55481a735bca\">Male Adult Names:&nbsp;Adran, Aelar, Aramil, Arannis, Aust, Beiro, Berrian, Carric, Enialis, Erdan, Erevan, Galinndan, Hadarai, Heian, Himo, Immeral, Ivellios, Laucian, Mindartis, Paelias, Peren, Quarion, Riardon, Rolen, Soveliss, Thamior, Tharivol,&nbsp;Theren, Varis</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4c3044b8-a2b0-4534-9346-270eb7f8ef00\">Female Adult Names:&nbsp;Adrie, Althaea, Anastrianna, Andraste, Antinua, Bethrynna, Birel, Caelynn, Drusilia, Enna, Felosial, Ielenia, Jelenneth, Keyleth, Leshanna, Lia, Meriele, Mialee, Naivara, Quelenna, Quillathe, Sariel, Shanairra, Shava, Silaqui, Theirastra, Thia, Vadania, Valanthe, Xanaphia</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2c6e177c-68ed-4209-9cb5-37a0f765ae3e\">Family Names (Common Translations):&nbsp;Amakiir (Gemflower), Amastacia (Starflower), Galanodel (Moonwhisper), Holimion (Diamonddew), Ilphelkiir (Gemblossom), Liadon (Silverfrond), Meliamne (Oakenheel), Na&iuml;lo (Nightbreeze), Siannodel (Moonbrook), Xiloscient (Goldpetal)</p>\n<h3 id=\"ElfTraits\" data-content-chunk-id=\"707851d9-700a-4a9e-a4b3-c94d16e1768c\">Elf Traits</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a612d713-585e-40f4-8925-499128dbf12f\"><a href=\"http://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/649/elf4.jpg\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\" data-content-chunk-id=\"541ab973-b2bf-4b71-bed7-b540935c03b2\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/649/300/375/elf4.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-content-chunk-id=\"a1909045-6398-4dff-ac35-ca22e939d434\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0c4d5306-036c-4235-abc9-ffe7ca760a40\">Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of thousands of years of elven refinement.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"02d20b2d-c458-418e-b0da-44f2361208c0\">Ability Score Increase.&nbsp;Your Dexterity score increases by 2.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1a0a2d04-019f-45cd-b55d-ff056f77cbd7\">Age.&nbsp;Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e2c60d4e-8cd7-4760-b61a-1dde8ddef3f9\">Alignment.&nbsp;Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others&rsquo; freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. The drow are an exception; their exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ef744f08-38f6-4431-b9cb-d80d76448041\">Size.&nbsp;Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b7bd719e-d2b0-455d-b4b0-7080e800a3e1\">Speed.&nbsp;Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1bbbeea0-529b-4b7b-ade7-e7f978d1d79c\">Darkvision.&nbsp;Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can&rsquo;t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"bf385382-61d0-4a96-9b18-b749d43f26e2\">Keen Senses.&nbsp;You have proficiency in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/14-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Perception</a>&nbsp;skill.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f9510c8f-847b-4617-bfeb-a3bcba6f650c\">Fey Ancestry.&nbsp;You have advantage on saving throws against being&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/2-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">charmed</a>, and magic can&rsquo;t put you to sleep.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0ff0d43c-81b7-4569-9560-98382b16a2a6\">Trance.&nbsp;Elves don&rsquo;t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is &ldquo;trance.&rdquo;) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3577816e-cfad-48cf-96fe-e8ec297316ff\">Languages.&nbsp;You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their&nbsp;repertoires.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"26765646-e558-42d2-946c-d8779b5b5730\">Subrace.&nbsp;Ancient divides among the elven people resulted in three main subraces: high elves, wood elves, and dark elves, who are commonly called drow. Choose one of these subraces. In some worlds, these subraces are divided still further (such as the sun elves and moon elves of the Forgotten Realms), so if you wish, you can choose a narrower subrace.</p>\n<blockquote data-content-chunk-id=\"1e8b3f6c-b54c-43ea-9969-eaeefee164ed\">\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"21c61551-2924-4ff2-bb7f-0d4f1103da40\">THE DARKNESS OF THE DROW</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"729f94bf-3a5b-4688-9a26-9fa952faaae5\">Were it not for one renowned exception, the race of drow would be universally reviled. To most, they are a race of demon-worshiping marauders dwelling in the subterranean depths of the Underdark, emerging only on the blackest nights to pillage and slaughter the surface dwellers they despise. Their society is depraved and preoccupied with the favor of Lolth, their spider-goddess, who sanctions murder and the extermination of entire families as noble houses vie for position.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3d3a4eef-8189-45b5-a4e4-ca01acc7b554\">Yet one drow, at least, broke the mold. In the world of the Forgotten Realms, Drizzt Do&rsquo;Urden, ranger of the North, has proven his quality as a good-hearted defender of the weak and innocent. Rejecting his heritage and adrift in a world that looks upon him with terror and loathing, Drizzt is a model for those few drow who follow in his footsteps, trying to find a life apart from the evil society of their Underdark homes.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8c0af214-c0f7-421f-b944-0f1f45e4ecb6\">Drow grow up believing that surface-dwelling races are inferior, worthless except as slaves. Drow who develop a conscience or find it necessary to cooperate with members of other races find it hard to overcome that prejudice, especially when they are so often on the receiving end of hatred.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"HighElf\" data-content-chunk-id=\"d7214404-a2a3-42d7-a50e-3fb134cee14c\">High Elf</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"afe8c2e8-dadb-4d68-b4df-9716ed2642ef\">As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds of D&amp;D, there are two kinds of high elves. One type (which includes the gray elves and valley elves of Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type (including the high elves of Greyhawk, the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and&nbsp;other races.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"be8e97b7-defe-481b-b338-de7583e2f36a\">The sun elves of Faer&ucirc;n (also called gold elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue. They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked with gold.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8c72e088-95a0-4083-a576-fae70d259ef8\">Ability Score Increase.&nbsp;Your Intelligence score increases by 1.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7f40324a-d5e4-4f0b-a6bd-ec08ea06f6f0\">Elf Weapon Training.&nbsp;You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow,&nbsp;and longbow.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"01caf8f2-a1b2-41ad-8c4b-44f3009977d8\">Cantrip.&nbsp;You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"049c3a1c-25bc-4400-bc72-abc5f0b87fc3\">Extra Language.&nbsp;You can speak, read, and write one extra language of&nbsp;your choice.</p>\n<h3 id=\"WoodElf\" data-content-chunk-id=\"ea18dc2f-ca23-4675-ac06-fef89caf9188\">Wood Elf</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f2725164-6ea5-4770-b0b2-89d63dfd7641\">As a wood elf, you have keen senses and intuition, and your fleet feet carry you quickly and stealthily through your native forests. This category includes the wild elves (grugach) of Greyhawk and the Kagonesti of Dragonlance, as well as the races called wood elves in Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms. In Faer&ucirc;n, wood elves (also called wild elves, green elves, or forest elves) are reclusive and distrusting&nbsp;of non-elves.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5215389b-2e0f-4c03-a8b8-c0f374cbe14a\">Wood elves&rsquo; skin tends to be copperish in hue, sometimes with traces of green. Their hair tends toward browns and blacks, but it is occasionally blond or copper-colored. Their eyes are green, brown, or hazel.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"65cac0fa-a145-4b4d-b252-9bf31f071222\">Ability Score Increase.&nbsp;Your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"09b148e2-b7e2-4acb-9e08-28c485fdeb4d\">Elf Weapon Training.&nbsp;You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow,&nbsp;and longbow.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7601d4dc-f53f-42a0-a1a9-fccf30d9077d\">Fleet of Foot.&nbsp;Your base walking speed increases to 35 feet.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0f4ba9a2-a6ed-440e-b6cd-363e955cbe11\">Mask of the Wild.&nbsp;You can attempt to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Hide\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/actions/8-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">hide</a>&nbsp;even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.</p>\n<h3 id=\"DarkElfDrow\" data-content-chunk-id=\"2825f92f-7475-42ad-a6b7-c0be536d5600\">&nbsp;</h3>","_id":"Fso837VX1pK2wFgJ"}

Branches of the organization are scattered throughout Faer&ucirc;n and often operate in isolation from the others. This existence teaches the Enclave&rsquo;s members a fierce self-reliance and mastery of certain fighting and survival skills.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\" data-content-chunk-id=\"806ac20d-801a-408f-bc55-e9afb3a0e7f3\">A ranger of the Enclave might be hired to lead a caravan through a treacherous mountain pass or the frozen tundra of Icewind Dale.

Barbarians and druids who live as hermits might appear from nowhere to help defend a town against marauding orcs.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\" data-content-chunk-id=\"9a643152-65ad-40ce-872b-b26ff8a225c6\">Members of the Emerald Enclave know how to survive and, more importantly, to help others do the same. They are not opposed to civilization or progress, but they strive to keep it in balance with the wild. They restore and preserve the natural order, even as they root out and destroy all that is unnatural. They keep the elemental forces of the world in check and keep civilization and the wilderness from destroying one another.</p>\n<blockquote style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\" data-content-chunk-id=\"c7f62612-ae86-44fd-b423-9d40cbf591e5\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" data-content-chunk-id=\"6e2ce930-a1ce-4cfd-a1d8-a57bf6f86c4b\">&ldquo;The Emerald Enclave exists as gatekeepers to that vast space beyond the city walls.

Clutching a shortsword in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one enemy after another.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"fd5c2fb7-053c-4851-8779-bca9fb7e473e\">After tumbling away from a cone of freezing air, an elf finds her feet and draws back her bow to loose an arrow at the white dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends one arrow after another to find the gaps between the dragon&rsquo;s thick scales.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"dafb85b5-10b6-4fb2-bdea-74b1c483b439\">Holding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his side. Whispering instructions in Elvish, he points to the owlbear he&rsquo;s been tracking and sends the hawk to distract the creature while he readies his bow.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0c9459a0-f559-49f2-bbdf-67c508db343b\">Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep their unending watch.</p>\n<h3 id=\"DeadlyHunters\" data-content-chunk-id=\"05c70617-c046-4335-8e05-f850df9d0518\">Deadly Hunters</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"eeff3093-53ca-43a3-bdb1-3b9e373f77a8\">Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of civilization &mdash; humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e34516cd-852c-48af-acad-ae3ea1a80670\">Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature&rsquo;s power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A ranger&rsquo;s talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.</p>\n<h3 id=\"IndependentAdventurers\" data-content-chunk-id=\"09a54630-5de1-4466-abb3-3edde9305335\">Independent Adventurers</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"fd16d00c-2e49-408d-aa55-c7e89aa20a1f\"><a href=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/705/c3ranger1.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/705/300/302/c3ranger1.png\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0027ee78-f9ef-4873-9539-2f4b5176f963\">Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a ranger&rsquo;s true calling is to defend the outskirts of civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in from the wild. In some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or a band of orcs attacks, a ranger might be the first &mdash; and possibly the last &mdash; line of defense.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"22b80714-ece0-4dd0-b3c0-9ad10a8ecd3b\">This fierce independence makes rangers well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization&rsquo;s foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.</p>\n<h3 id=\"CreatingaRanger\" data-content-chunk-id=\"f5cf33ba-4cc4-4f93-80f6-8678cb9d2b11\">Creating a Ranger</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f698297d-1f92-4838-9426-06410746888f\">As you create your ranger character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you mastered the ranger&rsquo;s ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain &mdash; perhaps by the same kind of monster that became your favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d65f9843-7430-4a7a-a350-c8453cb2fa7f\">What&rsquo;s the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change? What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?</p>\n<h4 id=\"QuickBuild\" data-content-chunk-id=\"eef785d2-18a8-4da9-9f71-a3f31396e3c8\">Quick Build</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"afdb9ed1-3dd0-4f5f-b954-7f92fd59c37e\">You can make a ranger quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. (Some rangers who focus on two-weapon fighting make Strength higher than Dexterity.) Second, choose the outlander background.</p>\n<div>\n<table data-content-chunk-id=\"9a61de40-abba-4f20-a52f-3fa1a448a8e8\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th rowspan=\"2\">\n<p>Level</p>\n</th>\n<th

You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ef470c3d-abb0-44ea-a415-6d04fbed52c1\">Spell save DC&nbsp;= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2dcd15f9-7bec-4244-87a6-de464e8cca6a\">Spell attack modifier&nbsp;= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<h3 id=\"RangerArchetype\" data-content-chunk-id=\"2c2553fe-4b00-4f08-8e5e-5e9810a0d84e\">Ranger Archetype</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3c1e1ed5-0631-4403-b925-aa46c0aad0a2\">At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: Hunter or Beast Master, both detailed at the end of the class description.

Through pacts made with mysterious beings of supernatural power, warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and spectacular. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as fey nobles, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power.</p>\n<h3 id=\"SwornandBeholden\" data-content-chunk-id=\"883a197f-bc3f-4fb6-be6b-fdea634f4187\">Sworn and Beholden</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"483babad-6b0d-49ba-bd20-1d6fd326175a\">A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly being. Sometimes the relationship between warlock and patron is like that of a cleric and a deity, though the beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are not gods. A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity &mdash; beings not typically served by clerics. More often, though, the arrangement is similar to that between a master and an apprentice. The warlock learns and grows in power, at the cost of occasional services performed on the patron&rsquo;s behalf.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c34199a6-e42c-43cd-bc29-4a61667f2537\">The magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor but lasting alterations to the warlock&rsquo;s being (such as the ability to see in darkness or to read any language) to access to powerful spells. Unlike bookish wizards, warlocks supplement their magic with some facility at hand-to-hand combat. They are comfortable in light armor and know how to use simple weapons.</p>\n<h3 id=\"DelversintoSecrets\" data-content-chunk-id=\"b76a30d2-d3ec-47c6-9c0a-4ac5c424163e\">Delvers into Secrets</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"dcd087b4-ff3e-4085-8402-49b9e86afa1f\">Warlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge and power, which compels them into their pacts and shapes their lives. This thirst drives warlocks into their pacts and shapes their later careers as well.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0e8cd938-661b-4163-8f9f-7d6d07ed54c8\">Stories of warlocks binding themselves to fiends are widely known. But many warlocks serve patrons that are not fiendish. Sometimes a traveler in the wilds comes to a strangely beautiful tower, meets its fey lord or lady, and stumbles into a pact without being fully aware of it. And sometimes, while poring over tomes of forbidden lore, a brilliant but crazed student&rsquo;s mind is opened to realities beyond the material world and to the alien beings that dwell in the outer void.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"00ca6031-ea86-41f7-9965-827e9bce33c3\">Once a pact is made, a warlock&rsquo;s thirst for knowledge and power can&rsquo;t be slaked with mere study and research. No one makes a pact with such a mighty patron if he or she doesn&rsquo;t intend to use the power thus gained. Rather, the vast majority of warlocks spend their days in active pursuit of their goals, which typically means some kind of adventuring. Furthermore, the demands of their patrons drive warlocks toward adventure.</p>\n<h3 id=\"CreatingaWarlock\" data-content-chunk-id=\"e989bfe2-5b82-4ef8-b4e4-7847e2f9cb6b\">Creating a Warlock</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"43ab8214-79d0-4c8f-a12f-bb7ac7fcde0a\"><a href=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/715/c3warlock1.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/715/300/300/c3warlock1.png\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"da1e3f4b-3267-4dbb-b395-78ce157de41d\">As you make your warlock character, spend some time thinking about your patron and the obligations that your pact imposes upon you. What led you to make the pact, and how did you make contact with your patron? Were you seduced into summoning a devil, or did you seek out the ritual that would allow you to make contact with an alien elder god? Did you search for your patron, or did your patron find and choose you? Do you chafe under the obligations of your pact or serve joyfully in anticipation of the rewards promised to you?</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3e9b27b8-573b-41d4-a25e-da5660efd9de\">Work with your DM to determine how big a part your pact will play in your character&rsquo;s adventuring career. Your patron&rsquo;s demands might drive you into adventures, or they might consist entirely of small favors you can do between adventures.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5f34ce0c-8ce7-4bae-90b7-18b73253734e\">What kind of relationship do you have with your patron? Is it friendly, antagonistic, uneasy, or romantic? How important does your patron consider you to be? What part do you play in your patron&rsquo;s plans? Do you know other servants of your patron?</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6b46058a-44cd-4115-84f2-5666e0712e71\">How does your patron communicate with you? If you have a familiar, it might occasionally speak with your patron&rsquo;s voice. Some warlocks find messages from their patrons etched on trees, mingled among tea leaves, or adrift in the clouds &mdash; messages that only the warlock can see. Other warlocks converse with their patrons in dreams or waking visions, or deal only with intermediaries.</p>\n<h4 id=\"QuickBuild\" data-content-chunk-id=\"ff95513a-4c4a-416b-b92e-a06a249c53c3\">Quick Build</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"095d033c-5d0d-400e-8f0f-4fd550a489ac\">You can make a warlock quickly by following these suggestions.

The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot.

A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what&rsquo;s shown in the table&rsquo;s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"55a20f75-5ba9-4ef3-81e5-15f637bbb5d2\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<h4 id=\"SpellcastingAbility\" data-content-chunk-id=\"2d86b4dc-e5e2-42d8-b580-1072942287ce\">Spellcasting Ability</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"82187cf5-b961-484d-a38b-855a14915750\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.

When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"206a1153-2846-4622-b07c-949d5f788dd5\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"PactBoon\" data-content-chunk-id=\"03a1c7b9-71ad-4815-9cae-b4108bb1ef15\">Pact Boon</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"29a55cd5-db28-4854-8d2f-2ea0a82789a8\">At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service.

You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it (see&nbsp;<a title=\"Weapons\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#Weapons\" data-content-chunk-id=\"53771276-3a11-4306-a79a-ee007b337984\">chapter 5</a>&nbsp;for weapon options). You are proficient with it while you wield it.

It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"23a3875e-f852-4ce7-a64b-4b85d5314e86\">You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can&rsquo;t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.</p>\n<h4 id=\"PactoftheTome\" data-content-chunk-id=\"90766d02-1078-42c7-8691-ac36c5cebcf8\">Pact of the Tome</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5ec537a3-3ee2-416a-bac9-5bcf5b7469a6\">Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class&rsquo;s spell list (the three needn&rsquo;t be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don&rsquo;t count against your number of cantrips known. If they don&rsquo;t appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"edeae4bf-acfc-4eee-9f35-1f3fbf7b040a\">If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.</p>\n<h3 id=\"WarlockAbilityScoreImprovement\" data-content-chunk-id=\"bf92afab-1f21-4505-9b64-009af4bb2faa\">Ability Score Improvement</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b9665573-8916-48e5-90c9-a013a0919cb5\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can&rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<h3 id=\"MysticArcanum\" data-content-chunk-id=\"e8cdd4e1-fb23-44cf-96c1-00a0af5fa324\">Mystic Arcanum</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"534e107d-9af5-4442-ac42-593019a03523\">At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"65e7c6f8-98d1-4302-b39f-3264157505e5\">You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"78146c7f-f3cd-4285-aade-8ec98b53d9f2\">At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h3 id=\"EldritchMaster\" data-content-chunk-id=\"3028ce63-456b-441e-816c-bd942335b764\">Eldritch Master</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c59bce91-4014-4852-921b-543ffb4db750\">At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p>\n<blockquote data-content-chunk-id=\"10c0412f-9c26-4cf1-b994-e8d7a25b147d\">\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6b54ed5f-3a12-4703-beb4-c15fe3d9d9c9\">YOUR PACT BOON</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0b10fcd1-c635-4974-b158-f8cb5f753a9f\">Each Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an object that reflects your patron&rsquo;s nature.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"41217be6-e1d5-4bdc-be7a-1fc6525da798\">Pact of the Chain.&nbsp;Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your patron, with sprites and pseudodragons tied to the Archfey and imps and quasits tied to the Fiend. Because the Great Old One&rsquo;s nature is inscrutable, any familiar form is suitable for it.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"be55376d-2eab-4657-a32a-754bdee8ce6b\">Pact of the Blade.&nbsp;If your patron is the Archfey, your weapon might be a slender blade wrapped in leafy vines. If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made of black metal and adorned with decorative flames. If your patron is the Great Old One, your weapon might be an ancient-looking spear, with a gemstone embedded in its head, carved to look like a terrible unblinking eye.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1f2a00e7-d1d2-4039-93f8-180d75572b09\">Pact of the Tome.&nbsp;Your Book of Shadows might be a fine, gilt-edged tome with spells of enchantment and illusion, gifted to you by the lordly Archfey. It could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend. Or it could be the tattered diary of a lunatic driven mad by contact with the Great Old One, holding scraps of spells that only your own burgeoning insanity allows you to understand and cast.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"OtherworldlyPatrons\" data-content-chunk-id=\"a7bcecf6-7ece-46d9-93b5-57b6cb50dd96\">Otherworldly Patrons</h2>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8f7bdcce-0451-4bf9-80d8-44d37ad4c1bc\">The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence &mdash; not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0cd10c14-5c2b-446a-92c0-d424b0d37ed6\">Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock.

{"name":"Social Interaction","permission":{"default":0,"s7gxOGja1p9WAX4j":3},"flags":{},"content":"<h2 id=\"SocialInteraction\" data-content-chunk-id=\"43edaed2-45e8-4604-8f9f-16c1d47a3605\">Social Interaction</h2>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ddbb5154-637f-40cf-b28f-a9b9c0278656\">Exploring dungeons, overcoming obstacles, and slaying monsters are key parts of D&amp;D adventures. No less important, though, are the social interactions that adventurers have with other inhabitants of the world.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"78e263f3-d93f-4eb8-ac79-f35a28629724\">Interaction takes on many forms. You might need to convince an unscrupulous thief to confess to some malfeasance, or you might try to flatter a dragon so that it will spare your life. The DM assumes the roles of any characters who are participating in the interaction that don&rsquo;t belong to another player at the table. Any such character is called a&nbsp;nonplayer character&nbsp;(NPC).</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"aad36361-e71a-4174-99a0-6b212dcd8328\">In general terms, an NPC&rsquo;s attitude toward you is described as friendly, indifferent, or hostile. Friendly NPCs are predisposed to help you, and hostile ones are inclined to get in your way. It&rsquo;s easier to get what you want from a friendly NPC, of course.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2f0312c4-3f69-469b-8006-a1e2fb2ba733\">Social interactions have two primary aspects: roleplaying and ability checks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Roleplaying\" data-content-chunk-id=\"8ca66aac-896d-4dab-995c-b09ca7bd3278\">Roleplaying</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"629ecea0-412f-4458-b668-0e152bec4acb\">Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role. In this case, it&rsquo;s you as a player determining how your character thinks, acts, and talks.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f3405357-b9b3-4e1d-af73-7e3c48176fbf\">Roleplaying is a part of every aspect of the game, and it comes to the fore during social interactions. Your character&rsquo;s quirks, mannerisms, and personality influence how interactions resolve.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5785696e-482a-4024-b739-d242e63de678\">There are two styles you can use when roleplaying your character: the descriptive approach and the active approach. Most players use a combination of the two styles. Use whichever mix of the two works best for you.</p>\n<h4 id=\"DescriptiveApproachtoRoleplaying\" data-content-chunk-id=\"b2864be2-fc48-4255-ada6-5afad8c86b5f\">Descriptive Approach to Roleplaying</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4ec5287a-7b7e-4576-87e3-8931ce8ee936\">With this approach, you describe your character&rsquo;s words and actions to the DM and the other players. Drawing on your mental image of your character, you tell everyone what your character does and how he or she does it.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a2a0311c-ed7f-4321-8b55-634e1daebcf2\">For instance, Chris plays Tordek the dwarf. Tordek has a quick temper and blames the elves of the Cloakwood for his family&rsquo;s misfortune. At a tavern, an obnoxious elf minstrel sits at Tordek&rsquo;s table and tries to strike up a conversation with the dwarf.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"de4259b4-e617-4e6d-a8ef-2f1985aa8cf5\">Chris says, &ldquo;Tordek spits on the floor, growls an insult at the bard, and stomps over to the bar. He sits on a stool and glares at the minstrel before ordering another drink.&rdquo;</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"358e0337-e355-48bc-b099-a09a8bf81f45\">In this example, Chris has conveyed Tordek&rsquo;s mood and given the DM a clear idea of his character&rsquo;s attitude and actions.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"106e2bb2-8131-4443-972e-99a5df87e9c1\">When using descriptive roleplaying, keep the following things in mind:</p>\n<ul data-content-chunk-id=\"81aeb7a4-19e8-45ee-b879-9b6f018b03a8\">\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"33884e4c-ba5c-4011-a1fa-74c17015bf58\">Describe your character&rsquo;s emotions and attitude.</li>\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"f1366a5e-06f0-465b-9a7b-601069071ae0\">Focus on your character&rsquo;s intent and how others might perceive it.</li>\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"85c7003d-805a-46c7-b350-25ca48f55bf8\">Provide as much embellishment as you feel comfortable with.</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e993c4be-b604-4fcb-b4af-8b1d6a4d6644\">Don&rsquo;t worry about getting things exactly right. Just focus on thinking about what your character would do and describing what you see in your mind.</p>\n<h4 id=\"ActiveApproachtoRoleplaying\" data-content-chunk-id=\"1a23917c-4ba0-4d58-96e3-ff76a0ef37e0\">Active Approach to Roleplaying</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4fd5af5b-5ea2-4e95-9c7d-78bcb1b217ff\">If descriptive roleplaying tells your DM and your fellow players what your character thinks and does, active roleplaying shows them.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e89cc8a4-9e26-496e-bddf-88f4a1b90fe8\">When you use active roleplaying, you speak with your character&rsquo;s voice, like an actor taking on a role. You might even echo your character&rsquo;s movements and body language. This approach is more immersive than descriptive roleplaying, though you still need to describe things that can&rsquo;t be reasonably acted out.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b377d4de-3d3c-4a54-94c4-88f2dde9c78c\">Going back to the example of Chris roleplaying Tordek above, here&rsquo;s how the scene might play out if Chris used active roleplaying:</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8ec3baaf-aef2-4bd5-9014-cc2a7018ac42\">Speaking as Tordek, Chris says in a gruff, deep voice, &ldquo;I was wondering why it suddenly smelled awful in here. If I wanted to hear anything out of you, I&rsquo;d snap your arm and enjoy your screams.&rdquo; In his normal voice, Chris then adds, &ldquo;I get up, glare at the elf, and head to the bar.&rdquo;</p>\n<h4 id=\"ResultsofRoleplaying\" data-content-chunk-id=\"3d95fa59-f4f6-4125-ab71-0cbdff66728f\">Results of Roleplaying</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c87a81e8-afd2-4c42-953b-80b5887288e6\">The DM uses your character&rsquo;s actions and attitudes to determine how an NPC reacts. A cowardly NPC buckles under threats of violence. A stubborn dwarf refuses to let anyone badger her. A vain dragon laps up flattery.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"66e12cc6-cb2f-4697-9052-30132bd1b9e1\">When interacting with an NPC, pay close attention to the DM&rsquo;s portrayal of the NPC&rsquo;s mood, dialogue, and personality. You might be able to determine an NPC&rsquo;s personality traits, ideals, flaws, and bonds, then play on them to influence the NPC&rsquo;s attitude.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"cc20bac9-118a-40e3-90ec-3bc10afe54db\">Interactions in D&amp;D are much like interactions in real life. If you can offer NPCs something they want, threaten them with something they fear, or play on their sympathies and goals, you can use words to get almost anything you want. On the other hand, if you insult a proud warrior or speak ill of a noble&rsquo;s allies, your efforts to convince or deceive will fall short.</p>\n<h3 id=\"AbilityChecks\" data-content-chunk-id=\"29ffdb01-7081-4e8f-98ce-d7ebcb114271\">Ability Checks</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"99dd5b08-8cea-4c6e-a961-6d92dd4cc8f1\">In addition to roleplaying, ability checks are key in determining the outcome of an interaction.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"99289263-b758-43cc-8f27-baf856c88ffa\">Your roleplaying efforts can alter an NPC&rsquo;s attitude, but there might still be an element of chance in the situation. For example, your DM can call for a Charisma check at any point during an interaction if he or she wants the dice to play a role in determining an NPC&rsquo;s reactions. Other checks might be appropriate in certain situations, at your DM&rsquo;s discretion.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"52a1f7a9-4c7e-4eb1-867f-6ffad35555d7\">Pay attention to your skill proficiencies when thinking of how you want to interact with an NPC, and stack the deck in your favor by using an approach that relies on your best bonuses and skills. If the group needs to trick a guard into letting them into a castle, the rogue who is proficient in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Deception\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/16-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Deception</a>&nbsp;is the best bet to lead the discussion.

A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b6e83e91-91b4-4748-9eb0-0a13ec89ac81\">Ingested.&nbsp;A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ca0e89c9-11d0-472d-86ed-7fa1d7c7f7de\">Inhaled.&nbsp;These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one's breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ec54d87e-27b7-4b55-990f-0537c535650b\">Injury.&nbsp;Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects.</p>\n<h3 id=\"SamplePoisons\" data-content-chunk-id=\"d33754d7-2ae4-4519-a79b-764d558993ca\">&nbsp;Sample Poisons</h3>\n<div>\n<table data-content-chunk-id=\"27f0411c-ee03-499e-a78c-f238d5ad01f2\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Item</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Price per Dose</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Assassin's blood</td>\n<td>Ingested</td>\n<td>150 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Burnt othur fumes</td>\n<td>Inhaled</td>\n<td>500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Crawler mucus</td>\n<td>Contact</td>\n<td>200 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Drow poison</td>\n<td>Injury</td>\n<td>200 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Essence of ether</td>\n<td>Inhaled</td>\n<td>300 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Malice</td>\n<td>Inhaled</td>\n<td>250 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Midnight tears</td>\n<td>Ingested</td>\n<td>1,500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Oil of taggit</td>\n<td>Contact</td>\n<td>400 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pale tincture</td>\n<td>Ingested</td>\n<td>250 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Purple worm poison</td>\n<td>Injury</td>\n<td>2,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Serpent venom</td>\n<td>Injury</td>\n<td>200 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Torpor</td>\n<td>Ingested</td>\n<td>600 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Truth serum</td>\n<td>Ingested</td>\n<td>150 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wyvern poison</td>\n<td>Injury</td>\n<td>1,200 gp</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"PoisonDescriptions\" data-content-chunk-id=\"76812d6a-a9da-44e3-9a3e-b9ead1846c21\">Poison Descriptions</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a46e949b-bbb7-40ae-9ff2-f1c4a2e22cac\">Each type of poison has its own debilitating effects.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6aad6252-f641-4d83-aca6-81b0a9687ebd\">Assassin's Blood (Ingested).&nbsp;A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw.

The Order understands that evil wears many guises, playing games and tricking others in order to spread. That is why its members act on their own authority, identifying threats and smashing them before they can grow.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\" data-content-chunk-id=\"efc4ca9a-1ade-4fda-9c3d-a9022d11b704\">Because the seeds of evil are nourished in the shadows, the Order of the Gauntlet rides out to the most dangerous dungeons, the darkest caverns, and the foulest pits to weed out wrongdoers. But the Order is keenly aware that the shadow of evil lies within everyone, waiting for a moment when it can gain a foothold on their souls. Thus its paladins, monks, and clerics spend long hours deep in prayer to keep their inner eye vigilant and focused on their own thoughts and emotions. In this way they purify themselves from within before taking up their swords to cleanse the world.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\" data-content-chunk-id=\"c5e563e5-faa4-4586-acb5-c980c2e0a26f\">The Order of the Gauntlet believes that all sentient beings must come to the light of reason and goodness of their own volition. That is why it is not interested in controlling minds: it focuses only on deeds, setting an example to the world in hopes of inspiring and enlightening others. The Order holds that faith in one&rsquo;s god, one&rsquo;s friends, and one&rsquo;s self are the greatest weapons in quelling the hordes of malice.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\" data-content-chunk-id=\"b7ee1ccd-ff9f-4cf2-941f-fdb13946382f\">With such devout conviction, the Order&rsquo;s members can be depended on as a source of strength to themselves and others, a bright light against the darkness. They are not preemptive bullies, though. A strict code of honor allows them to strike only when evil deeds are being committed. Thus, the Order of the Gauntlet is hypervigilant, using every resource at their disposal&mdash;both divine and mundane&mdash;to know where and when dark deeds will occur.</p>\n<blockquote style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\" data-content-chunk-id=\"43259efe-0848-47be-b6f2-7ae2fb24c75b\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" data-content-chunk-id=\"37be9048-9f8a-4990-8508-7f65e9118835\">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the thing about evil: it is darkness, it is shadow, it hides in your blind spot. Then, when you are distracted, it sneaks in. Evil is a master of disguise&mdash;and what is the greatest disguise, you ask? Yourself. Evil will cloak itself in thoughts and emotions pretending to be your own, telling you to get angry, to be greedy and envious, to hold yourself above others.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" data-content-chunk-id=\"2e1a6043-879b-402c-91de-cbb8fdcfaa8e\">&ldquo;People aren&rsquo;t born evil&mdash;it takes time for evil to fool you into thinking that its voice is yours. That is why to know who you truly are is what the Order requires from each hopeful who wishes to join our ranks. Bravery isn&rsquo;t fighting the dragon out there&mdash;it is fighting the dragon within. That is what we do in our prayers. Once you have slain that dragon, you have overcome the darkness lurking within yourself. Only then do you have the capacity to know true goodness. Only then are you ready to take up the sword and wear the badge of our Order.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" data-content-chunk-id=\"0a8a24c8-bd05-460c-ba4c-d8c98b4e5fa2\">Kajiso Steelhand</p>\n</blockquote>","_id":"KpXqKHJJHvTPRNH0"}

The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they're moving over.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Speed\" data-content-chunk-id=\"c397a1d4-9602-4aae-80a9-fb19076dcb9e\">Speed</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"da060fb5-124a-4245-9636-3742f84dfc4c\">Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation. The following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.</p>\n<h4 id=\"TravelPace\" data-content-chunk-id=\"b657160b-eedd-46d5-ac52-0813f14f043c\">Travel Pace</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7ee83eab-7cb5-49dd-90fb-bc558e268fe9\">While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"88dc17a1-acb5-4205-8f33-eaf09b4b4002\">Forced March.&nbsp;The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f83944ef-a82f-4ec0-8f5b-c179cb21752c\">For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/4-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">exhaustion</a>.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b7236ff3-f54a-4986-b3e9-44f95cc1b084\">Mounts and Vehicles.&nbsp;For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e9e57305-0a30-4a81-b37d-024a5dd2658e\">Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don't suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace.

You ignore this extra cost if you have a climbing speed and use it to climb or a swimming speed and use it to swim. At the DM&rsquo;s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/2-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Athletics</a>) check.

A marching order makes it easier to determine which characters are affected by traps, which ones can spot hidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to those enemies when a fight breaks out.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"991fd1f5-c808-4232-879e-733e33e27673\">A character might occupy the front rank, one or more middle ranks, or the back rank. Characters in the front and back ranks need enough room to travel side by side with others in their rank. When space is too tight, the marching order must change, usually by moving characters to a middle rank.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2bb807b3-eb13-4964-b42e-3160bd3fab9c\">Fewer Than Three Ranks.&nbsp;If an adventuring party arranges its marching order with only two ranks, they are a front rank and a back rank. If there&rsquo;s only one rank, it&rsquo;s considered a front rank.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Stealth\" data-content-chunk-id=\"542965f2-25c6-4c01-9ae4-25cced183fff\">Stealth</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"04c43feb-c489-485f-98cd-3b5bf082bfad\">While traveling at a slow pace, the characters can move stealthily. As long as they&rsquo;re not in the open, they can try to surprise or sneak by other creatures they encounter. See the rules for hiding in the&nbsp;<a title=\"Using Ability Scores\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Dexterity\" data-content-chunk-id=\"857f0605-d449-4ce1-8186-39b1c2840d43\">Using Ability Scores</a>&nbsp;section.</p>\n<blockquote data-content-chunk-id=\"682ee8f2-3c75-4b2b-92ea-3a00a75a09a5\">\n<p id=\"splitting-up-the-party\" data-content-chunk-id=\"21d2b1c9-5072-4ef7-b381-d42fa5b92e3c\">SPLITTING UP THE PARTY</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c05d4822-3c04-494e-bcfe-a67f1a418777\">Sometimes, it makes sense to split an adventuring party, especially if you want one or more characters to scout ahead. You can form multiple parties, each moving at a different speed. Each group has its own front, middle, and back ranks.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"388db6c0-417c-49cc-9c5d-7e71553e65cd\">The drawback to this approach is that the party will be split into several smaller groups in the event of an attack. The advantage is that a small group of stealthy characters moving slowly might be able to sneak past enemies that clumsier characters would alert. A pair of rogues moving at a slow pace are much harder to detect when they leave their dwarf fighter friend behind.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"NoticingThreats\" data-content-chunk-id=\"cff3566b-6586-4e23-82e4-24e31ff87506\">Noticing Threats</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"dc14c0d4-2cdf-401d-bea8-d6a22822eccc\">Use the passive Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/14-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Perception</a>) scores of the characters to determine whether anyone in the group notices a hidden threat. The DM might decide that a threat can be noticed only by characters in a particular rank. For example, as the characters are exploring a maze of tunnels, the DM might decide that only those characters in the back rank have a chance to hear or spot a stealthy creature following the group, while characters in the front and middle ranks cannot.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"14781d5b-cb0d-40f5-9139-54556ee49735\">While traveling at a fast pace, characters take a &ndash;5 penalty to their passive Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/14-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Perception</a>) scores to notice hidden threats.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0bdb6aab-1b1a-4d23-a512-ae355ef11c0e\">Encountering Creatures.&nbsp;If the DM determines that the adventurers encounter other creatures while they&rsquo;re traveling, it&rsquo;s up to both groups to decide what happens next. Either group might decide to attack, initiate a conversation, run away, or wait to see what the other group does.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"db2c6f72-ce35-4253-8eb0-24f82222dad0\">Surprising Foes.&nbsp;If the adventurers encounter a hostile creature or group, the DM determines whether the adventurers or their foes might be surprised when combat erupts.

Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal.

The cleric and the druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must also have the spell prepared or on his or her list of spells known, unless the character's ritual feature specifies otherwise, as the wizard's does.</p>","_id":"MuziKS2Wpx9pcyMi"}

Four categories of characteristics are presented here: personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Beyond those categories, think about your character&rsquo;s favorite words or phrases, tics and habitual gestures, vices and pet peeves, and whatever else you can imagine.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1e6b3d46-0bdc-4650-8b18-49bc04a57302\">Each background presented later in this chapter&nbsp;includes suggested characteristics that you can use to spark your imagination. You&rsquo;re not bound to those options, but they&rsquo;re a good starting point.</p>\n<h4 id=\"PersonalityTraits\" data-content-chunk-id=\"a24e9e6f-0e9c-4dfe-9d44-cc9f15e0d029\">Personality Traits</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6ac2988d-9693-4372-b11b-ace4ddd8321e\">Give your character two personality traits. Personality traits are small, simple ways to help you set your character apart from every other character. Your personality traits should tell you something interesting and fun about your character. They should be self-descriptions that are specific about what makes your character stand out. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m smart&rdquo; is not a good trait, because it describes a lot of characters. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read every book in Candlekeep&rdquo; tells you something specific about your character&rsquo;s interests and disposition.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"52507d71-117d-495c-ba61-9875dbe166eb\">Personality traits might describe the things your character likes, his or her past accomplishments, things your character dislikes or fears, your character&rsquo;s self-attitude or mannerisms, or the influence of his or her ability scores.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3307184e-2896-4849-bedf-a2a9b0786a86\">A useful place to start thinking about personality traits is to look at your highest and lowest ability scores and define one trait related to each. Either one could be positive or negative: you might work hard to overcome a low score, for example, or be cocky about your high score.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Ideals\" data-content-chunk-id=\"5d4361fd-9b1c-41ee-8ddd-e5074ee02bf3\">Ideals</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0750a7c6-aaac-46ca-a957-effbb07d7c96\">Describe one ideal that drives your character. Your ideals are the things that you believe in most strongly, the fundamental moral and ethical principles that compel you to act as you do. Ideals encompass everything from your life goals to your core belief system.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e50616d4-6482-4b7e-913b-997d227f3e60\">Ideals might answer any of these questions: What are the principles that you will never betray? What would prompt you to make sacrifices? What drives you to act and guides your goals and ambitions? What is the single most important thing you strive for?</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"28af66e1-e013-4e07-9db7-f4955e6820a7\">You can choose any ideals you like, but your character&rsquo;s alignment is a good place to start defining them. Each background in this chapter&nbsp;includes six suggested ideals. Five of them are linked to aspects of alignment: law, chaos, good, evil, and neutrality. The last one has more to do with the particular background than with moral or ethical perspectives.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Bonds\" data-content-chunk-id=\"04337fa2-52f7-4bd6-b078-8eb3bd400ae6\">Bonds</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1d0f504a-1b4c-4ab6-8bf8-2662e41f2a12\">Create one bond for your character. Bonds represent a character&rsquo;s connections to people, places, and events in the world. They tie you to things from your background. They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead you to act against your own best interests if they are threatened. They can work very much like ideals, driving a character&rsquo;s motivations and goals.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"60953727-49ae-4821-8710-4b45dbaad2b6\">Bonds might answer any of these questions: Whom do you care most about? To what place do you feel a special connection? What is your most treasured possession?</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"cb9a9f84-67c1-4a82-88af-f23a883172e3\">Your bonds might be tied to your class, your background, your race, or some other aspect of your character&rsquo;s history or personality. You might also gain new bonds over the course of your adventures.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Flaws\" data-content-chunk-id=\"f2d920ac-ea23-4fc7-a2a1-b10f627a42bc\">Flaws</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"83bf298f-edea-40e3-b41e-850640c92e9d\">Finally, choose a flaw for your character. Your character&rsquo;s flaw represents some vice, compulsion, fear, or weakness&mdash;in particular, anything that someone else could exploit to bring you to ruin or cause you to act against your best interests. More significant than negative personality traits, a flaw might answer any of these questions: What enrages you? What&rsquo;s the one person, concept, or event that you are terrified of? What are your vices?</p>\n<blockquote data-content-chunk-id=\"f1ee528b-45d3-49b6-84e2-a14a8afc97df\">\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b96e02a6-ee57-4c88-b577-baf4b5a54918\">TIKA AND ARTEMIS: PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b012438e-e6f6-44a5-993f-b2d145ae8333\">Tika and Artemis have distinct personality traits. Tika Waylan dislikes boastfulness and has a fear of heights resulting from a bad fall during her career as a thief. Artemis Entreri is always prepared for the worst and moves with a quick, precise confidence.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"aadf1e12-5a1a-42bf-89e6-6e0279c5e930\">Consider their ideals. Tika Waylan is innocent, almost childlike, believing in the value of life and the importance of appreciating everyone. Neutral good in alignment, she cleaves to ideals of life and respect. Artemis Entreri never allows his emotions to master him, and he constantly challenges himself to improve his skills. His lawful evil alignment gives him ideals of impartiality and a lust for power.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"65352186-6ad7-4ac8-b59d-be5ada3b2e92\">Tika Waylan&rsquo;s bond is to the Inn of the Last Home. The inn&rsquo;s proprietor gave her a new chance at life, and her friendship with her adventuring companions was forged during her time working there. Its destruction by the marauding dragonarmies gives Tika a very personal reason to hate them with a fiery passion. Her bond might be phrased as &ldquo;I will do whatever it takes to punish the dragonarmies for the destruction of the Inn of the Last Home.&rdquo;</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"63cf27c1-b4bd-4b23-bdc1-f6fa2f1aeef9\">Artemis Entreri&rsquo;s bond is a strange, almost paradoxical relationship with Drizzt Do&rsquo;Urden, his equal in swordplay and grim determination. In his first battle with Drizzt, Artemis recognized something of himself in his opponent, some indication that if his life had gone differently, he might have led a life more like the heroic drow&rsquo;s. From that moment, Artemis is more than a criminal assassin&mdash;he is an antihero, driven by his rivalry with Drizzt. His bond might be phrased as &ldquo;I will not rest until I have proved myself better than Drizzt Do&rsquo;Urden.&rdquo;</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a5844c0b-843b-45f1-b93e-d56949476e20\">Each of these characters also has an important flaw. Tika Waylan is naive and emotionally vulnerable, younger than her companions and annoyed that they still think of her as the kid they knew years ago.

As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.</p>\n<h3 id=\"HealersandWarriors\" data-content-chunk-id=\"c67047db-bda8-46ea-8eb6-90431bd475fd\">Healers and Warriors</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"18b1a79e-6e10-4b23-87ac-d70b23f20743\">Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of the gods, flowing from them into the world. Clerics are conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous effects. The gods don&rsquo;t grant this power to everyone who seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"575e637a-620f-489d-bdc8-f3b14cc41570\">Harnessing divine magic doesn&rsquo;t rely on study or training. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion and an intuitive sense of a deity&rsquo;s wishes.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c4e1e99f-f3af-4510-aad3-4509bcb70f85\">Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat training to let them wade into melee with the power of the gods on their side.</p>\n<h3 id=\"DivineAgents\" data-content-chunk-id=\"2c02ba5e-5879-4b93-a522-4cde12402cf7\">Divine Agents</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6e236174-fcb5-4b02-81d7-31913c3e3e7d\"><a href=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/685/c3cleric1.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/685/380/343/c3cleric1.png\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f6ea943c-57f5-4786-a462-b08390a0e70d\">Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their gods&rsquo; will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic and strength of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and involving no communion with a god at all. True clerics are rare in most hierarchies.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e358c847-92c9-4408-ba2c-0b159c1e47bd\">When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect their deities&rsquo; worshipers, which can mean fighting rampaging orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations, or sealing a portal that would allow a demon prince to enter the world.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f90fbfc0-51cc-4ddf-b7c8-d7286f6132f4\">Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple might ask for a cleric&rsquo;s aid, or a high priest might be in a position to demand it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"CreatingaCleric\" data-content-chunk-id=\"55d86f25-b27b-441b-9310-272b714a79e0\">Creating a Cleric</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7e324fb5-e23f-4b1c-8663-524905626fc9\">As you create a cleric, the most important question to consider is which deity to serve and what principles you want your character to embody.&nbsp;<a title=\"Gods of the Multiverse\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-b-gods-of-the-multiverse#GodsoftheMultiverse\" data-content-chunk-id=\"5412c7b9-5e7a-41f1-8b30-20817677f0df\">Appendix B</a>&nbsp;includes lists of many of the gods of the multiverse. Check with your DM to learn which deities are in your campaign.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1c154ca7-9267-4a21-b6ce-017c540b94af\">Once you&rsquo;ve chosen a deity, consider your cleric&rsquo;s relationship to that god. Did you enter this service willingly? Or did the god choose you, impelling you into service with no regard for your wishes? How do the temple priests of your faith regard you: as a champion or a troublemaker? What are your ultimate goals? Does your deity have a special task in mind for you? Or are you striving to prove yourself worthy of a great quest?</p>\n<h4 id=\"QuickBuild\" data-content-chunk-id=\"66756655-750b-4598-9b5b-35dd468f5d23\">Quick Build</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8262646f-c202-4ad2-88f0-db6a8769dd83\">You can make a cleric quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Strength or Constitution. Second, choose the acolyte background.</p>\n<div>\n<table data-content-chunk-id=\"b5b224bb-845a-4c18-b681-dc48814e5fc0\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th rowspan=\"2\">\n<p>Level</p>\n</th>\n<th

spells.

You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.</p>\n<h4 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" data-content-chunk-id=\"5e44d106-149d-47c0-b466-a60fb0d13c22\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3b5841a0-4fc0-4ead-9495-e266933fcb02\">The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&rsquo;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7a759041-5c47-4bc6-b502-c87c70de8fc4\">You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6aa0c475-922a-4805-91fe-542f312b19b3\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell&nbsp;cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&rsquo;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8499e90a-0e02-468d-8d48-c4e442c14293\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.

The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9b39c8f3-7bfa-467a-97c4-34cdfdd4b27b\">Spell save DC&nbsp;= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d3e26894-10c3-4629-b3f2-7d02f4eddbff\">Spell attack modifier&nbsp;= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<h4 id=\"RitualCasting\" data-content-chunk-id=\"27855ad8-0815-4155-8854-82f8adbb0110\">Ritual Casting</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"aead653d-491a-41fc-bc3c-fe06de9bf28f\">You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\n<h4 id=\"SpellcastingFocus\" data-content-chunk-id=\"a1eaae48-3841-49ab-85ab-1eaa3a9bb48f\">Spellcasting Focus</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b9eb80bc-b6e2-4091-a2c5-d38ae17701e4\">You can use a holy symbol (see chapter 5, &ldquo;<a title=\"Holy Symbol\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#HolySymbol\" data-content-chunk-id=\"eaca9277-7713-4469-9008-63ac7f5dc58c\">Equipment</a>&rdquo;) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.</p>\n<h3 id=\"DivineDomain\" data-content-chunk-id=\"9d739c2e-9e3b-447f-a407-65a3461b460f\">Divine Domain</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"138682a0-fc90-46f3-b481-d3b78e610dbc\">Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.</p>\n<h4 id=\"DomainSpells\" data-content-chunk-id=\"cc19bc86-2ad9-4690-b363-1eb17ce16b9b\">Domain Spells</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"34164443-3069-48d5-bb81-13ad3e86c1f4\">Each domain has a list of spells &mdash; its domain spells &mdash; that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn&rsquo;t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5caf9db8-1294-46f1-a336-4489e338bae5\">If you have a domain spell that doesn&rsquo;t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ChannelDivinity\" data-content-chunk-id=\"75b1ab5b-210a-4556-8ade-ba4ecb3dfa4d\">Channel Divinity</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ceb21a76-728a-4aa5-9158-8840a7c52f8a\">At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4b6a7084-12f0-4afc-8e7e-9a90a29fc90e\">When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7c858875-4205-4bfd-8505-300df6e89f1f\">Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"56dcf56d-3c97-443b-8f14-d5cc4ba0c606\">Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</p>\n<h4 id=\"ChannelDivinityTurnUndead\" data-content-chunk-id=\"4081359d-28b2-414b-8945-2c71763735a1\">Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"fb1ca38a-637f-4f3f-ad6e-8f0c81a70de6\">As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9eec5f2d-c032-4ba4-a880-0c4d509eddee\">A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can&rsquo;t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can&rsquo;t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Dash\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/actions/4-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Dash</a>&nbsp;action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there&rsquo;s nowhere to move, the creature can use the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Dodge\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/actions/6-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Dodge</a>&nbsp;action.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ClericAbilityScoreImprovement\" data-content-chunk-id=\"a9e26dd1-2964-48e0-b8d1-cf893cd1c6dd\">Ability Score Improvement</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"146177a7-3e7e-4f36-ab91-5d740fe61238\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can&rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<h3 id=\"DestroyUndead\" data-content-chunk-id=\"81d8eac2-66f4-4463-ab9b-f2a93fbf57f8\">Destroy Undead</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5767bd2c-77d5-42af-babb-61d7c10c22e7\">Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"85755bd7-2e45-439b-9738-73d0403f340b\">Destroy Undead</p>\n<div>\n<table data-content-chunk-id=\"6a7273b2-586e-4117-b2cc-a3b50fa4d9c1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Cleric Level</th>\n<th>Destroys Undead of CR . . .</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>1/2 or lower</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>1 or lower</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11th</td>\n<td>2 or lower</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>3 or lower</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>4 or lower</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"DivineIntervention\" data-content-chunk-id=\"b8ce8255-fcb3-48d3-a1af-40e1d9f3e122\">Divine Intervention</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"eb5cd50d-7a5c-47b2-92e5-63e2767ad231\">Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0392dc9d-b4e5-4a5b-95c2-c21f63dff5dc\">Imploring your deity&rsquo;s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"77b3c2b5-7ac3-4454-b268-8264952d24e7\">If your deity intervenes, you can&rsquo;t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0e6aaec3-222c-4460-948f-983ed61e10ca\">At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.</p>\n<h2 id=\"DivineDomains\" data-content-chunk-id=\"1a5e1fbe-e1b4-4e31-971f-966bfae52177\">Divine Domains</h2>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9d57674b-3657-4e0e-96de-204034309f4d\"><a href=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/686/c3cleric2.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/686/300/441/c3cleric2.png\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b0905e6e-4979-4c48-a516-64f717b2c723\">In a pantheon, every deity has influence over different aspects of mortal life and civilization, called a deity&rsquo;s domain. All the domains over which a deity has influence are called the deity&rsquo;s portfolio. For example, the portfolio of the Greek god Apollo includes the domains of Knowledge, Life, and Light. As a cleric, you choose one aspect of your deity&rsquo;s portfolio to emphasize, and you are granted powers related to that domain.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4d4bf5fe-70a8-48e4-8642-3b3a133ee5e9\">Your choice might correspond to a particular sect dedicated to your deity. Apollo, for example, could be worshiped in one region as Phoebus (&ldquo;radiant&rdquo;) Apollo, emphasizing his influence over the Light domain, and in a different place as Apollo Acesius (&ldquo;healing&rdquo;), emphasizing his association with the Life domain. Alternatively, your choice of domain could simply be a matter of personal preference, the aspect of the deity that appeals to you most.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7ba5661a-05bb-48f8-aefd-4c98bef8b16f\">Each domain&rsquo;s description gives examples of deities who have influence over that domain. Gods are included from the worlds of the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, Dragonlance, and Eberron campaign settings, as well as from the Celtic, Greek, Norse, and Egyptian pantheons of antiquity.</p>\n<h3 id=\"LifeDomain\" data-content-chunk-id=\"4236b850-6ac9-4294-a461-fb90a8385492\">Life Domain</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4a4c8f6f-0ba5-49b3-9f59-7091d62b3623\">The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy &mdash; one of the fundamental forces of the universe &mdash; that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).</p>\n<h4 id=\"LifeDomainSpells\" data-content-chunk-id=\"318e52a1-ec5a-409e-8356-7bef2d0aa1df\">Life Domain Spells</h4>\n<div>\n<table data-content-chunk-id=\"06c21a6d-1060-432d-b14a-f7c3f4577dbc\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Cleric Level</th>\n<th>Spells</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>1st</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/bless\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2016-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">bless</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cure-wounds\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2056-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">cure wounds</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>3rd</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/lesser-restoration\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2164-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">lesser restoration</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/spiritual-weapon\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2263-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">spiritual weapon</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>5th</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/beacon-of-hope\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2012-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">beacon of hope</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/revivify\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2234-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">revivify</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>7th</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/death-ward\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2061-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">death ward</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/guardian-of-faith\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2130-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">guardian of faith</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>9th</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/mass-cure-wounds\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2181-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">mass cure wounds</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/raise-dead\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2224-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">raise dead</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"BonusProficiency\" data-content-chunk-id=\"d7e56053-8637-44ab-81f8-b562382aa2ed\">Bonus Proficiency</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2a7da93d-029f-4109-9efc-042a88e7697e\">When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.</p>\n<h4 id=\"DiscipleofLife\" data-content-chunk-id=\"752fdbd5-d5f4-4818-aba7-f566bf16328b\">Disciple of Life</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"357e4c33-aa0e-4025-8920-fa52de457c2f\">Also starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more effective.

Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can&rsquo;t use this feature on an undead or a construct.</p>\n<h4 id=\"BlessedHealer\" data-content-chunk-id=\"6e346c9b-fb03-43b6-99b7-14a3cad2b698\">Blessed Healer</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e52dcd36-fe76-4b61-87d9-66139e996711\">Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal you as well.

Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p>\n<h4 id=\"SupremeHealing\" data-content-chunk-id=\"7e1a8e34-b6db-41e9-926d-1a11a52d0f52\">Supreme Healing</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"47094954-d38e-4e18-a87e-b7ee83df4784\">Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.</p>","_id":"OCP13dRXFZXYMhOg"}

It&rsquo;s more than a profession; it&rsquo;s your character&rsquo;s calling. Class shapes the way you think about the world and interact with it and your relationship with other people and powers in the multiverse. A fighter, for example, might view the world in pragmatic terms of strategy and maneuvering, and see herself as just a pawn in a much larger game. A cleric, by contrast, might see himself as a willing servant in a god&rsquo;s unfolding plan or a conflict brewing among various deities. While the fighter has contacts in a mercenary company or army, the cleric might know a number of priests, paladins, and devotees who share his faith.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b77dbcae-d551-436d-b0cf-bc1e0d48ddb2\">Your class gives you a variety of special features, such as a fighter&rsquo;s mastery of weapons and armor, and a wizard&rsquo;s spells. At low levels, your class gives you only two or three features, but as you advance in level you gain more and your existing features often improve. Each class entry in this chapter&nbsp;includes a table summarizing the benefits you gain at every level, and a detailed explanation of each one.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f1be0740-b855-41f7-b9a0-27af9961fa3a\">Adventurers sometimes advance in more than one class. A rogue might switch direction in life and swear the oath of a paladin. A barbarian might discover latent magical ability and dabble in the sorcerer class while continuing to advance as a barbarian.

When gods walk the world, clerics channel divine power, evil cults perform dark sacrifices in subterranean lairs, and shining paladins stand like beacons against the darkness, it&rsquo;s hard to be ambivalent about the deities and deny their existence.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f6816f89-f7fb-402e-a9c0-db146dea5674\">Many people in the worlds of D&amp;D worship different gods at different times and circumstances. People in the Forgotten Realms, for example, might pray to Sune for luck in love, make an offering to Waukeen before heading to the market, and pray to appease Talos when a severe storm blows in&mdash;all in the same day. Many people have a favorite among the gods, one whose ideals and teachings they make their own. And a few people dedicate themselves entirely to a single god, usually serving as a priest or champion of that god&rsquo;s ideals.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ea2f44e5-36a8-4304-87ec-8f60c7e256ab\">Your DM determines which gods, if any, are worshiped in his or her campaign. From among the gods available, you can choose a single deity for your character to serve, worship, or pay lip service to. Or you can pick a few that your character prays to most often. Or just make a mental note of the gods who are revered in your DM&rsquo;s campaign so you can invoke their names when appropriate. If you&rsquo;re playing a cleric or a character with the Acolyte background, decide which god your deity serves or served, and consider the deity&rsquo;s suggested domains when selecting your character&rsquo;s domain.</p>\n<h2 id=\"DDPantheons\" data-content-chunk-id=\"9232ab47-2489-4227-bbce-e097b50e47e2\">D&amp;D Pantheons</h2>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4860a26f-47f1-4f51-b6e2-a34e666d92e2\">Each world in the D&amp;D multiverse has its own pantheons of deities. This appendix deals with one pantheon, that of the Forgotten Realms.</p>\n<h3 id=\"TheForgottenRealms\" data-content-chunk-id=\"a8e5509c-1670-418b-92a2-a93be2062d49\">The Forgotten Realms</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"150281ee-0cd4-4235-a6d9-b176d56bfc94\">Dozens of deities are revered, worshiped, and feared throughout the world of the Forgotten Realms. At least thirty deities are widely known across the Realms, and many more are worshiped locally, by individual tribes, small cults, or certain sects of larger religious temples.</p>\n<h3 id=\"NonhumanDeities\" data-content-chunk-id=\"537c12a3-2844-4306-9a31-bb93a28050d2\">Nonhuman Deities</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"86fe0f82-f67c-466a-a216-1364b46e11e1\">Certain gods closely associated with nonhuman races are revered on many different worlds, though not always in the same way. The nonhuman races of the Forgotten Realms and Greyhawk share these deities.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"953d702a-1f10-4eba-9f1b-17da8d203b12\">Nonhuman races often have whole pantheons of their own. Besides Moradin, for example, the dwarf gods include Moradin&rsquo;s wife, Berronar Truesilver, and a number of other gods thought to be their children and grandchildren: Abbathor, Clangeddin Silverbeard, Dugmaren Brightmantle, Dumathoin, Gorm Gulthyn, Haela Brightaxe, Marthammor Duin, Sharindlar, Thard Harr, and Vergadain. Individual clans and kingdoms of dwarves might revere some, all, or none of these deities, and some have other gods unknown (or known by other names) to outsiders.</p>\n<h4

As described in the&nbsp;<a title=\"Classes (Cleric)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/classes#Cleric\">Classes</a>&nbsp;section, though, the Life domain is incredibly broad, and a cleric of any non-evil deity can choose it.</p>\n<p>A number of other deities, mostly evil ones, suggest the Death domain, which is detailed in the&nbsp;Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide. Most clerics who choose this domain are evil NPCs, but if you want to worship a god of death, consult your Dungeon Master.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<h2 id=\"FantasyHistoricalPantheons\" data-content-chunk-id=\"3c7beee1-c110-43a0-9142-20daf6b3d649\">Fantasy-Historical Pantheons</h2>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8c3905c8-b817-4c05-890f-0700fd25c84d\">The Celtic, Egyptian, Greek, and Norse pantheons are fantasy interpretations of historical religions from our world&rsquo;s ancient times. They include deities that are most appropriate for use in a D&amp;D game, divorced from their historical context in the real world and united into pantheons that serve the needs&nbsp;of the game.</p>\n<h3 id=\"TheCelticPantheon\" data-content-chunk-id=\"24fa25bd-a3c8-401b-bcff-02a2c4d4c288\">The Celtic Pantheon</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ae139f8e-99c2-4155-8019-3e1ae38ef2ae\">It&rsquo;s said that something wild lurks in the heart of every soul, a space that thrills to the sound of geese calling at night, to the whispering wind through the pines, to the unexpected red of mistletoe on an oak&mdash;and it is in this space that the Celtic gods dwell. They sprang from the brook and stream, their might heightened by the strength of the oak and the beauty of the woodlands and open moor. When the first forester dared put a name to the face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling in a brook, these gods forced themselves into being.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"08f9cefe-64ad-44bd-830a-68a9fe6af0d1\">The Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by clerics, for they are closely aligned with the forces of nature that druids revere.</p>\n<h3 id=\"TheGreekPantheon\" data-content-chunk-id=\"7133927e-9a96-45b4-ae70-cd25df047041\">The Greek Pantheon</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4d532940-a295-4bf5-bc2e-b6f50f86817a\">The gods of Olympus make themselves known with the gentle lap of waves against the shores and the crash of the thunder among the cloud-enshrouded peaks. The thick boar-infested woods and the sere, olive-covered hillsides hold evidence of their passing.&nbsp;Every aspect&nbsp;of nature echoes with their presence, and they&rsquo;ve made a place for themselves inside the human heart, too.</p>\n<h3 id=\"TheEgyptianPantheon\" data-content-chunk-id=\"2b95396d-7739-4fbf-819a-2580cbd01c7c\">The Egyptian Pantheon</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f7ee421d-d221-4fce-9ae8-c072812d0921\">These gods are a young dynasty of an ancient divine family, heirs to the rulership of the cosmos and the maintenance of the divine principle of Ma&rsquo;at&mdash;the fundamental order of truth, justice, law, and order that puts gods, mortal pharaohs, and ordinary men and women in their logical and rightful place in&nbsp;the universe.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2534afe5-bfaf-4693-ba0b-bcce579c61a1\">The Egyptian pantheon is unusual in having three gods with the Death domain of different alignments. Anubis is the lawful neutral god of the afterlife, who judges the souls of the dead. Set is a chaotic evil god of murder, perhaps best known for killing his brother Osiris. And Nephthys is a chaotic good goddess of mourning. Thus, although most clerics of the Death domain (found in the&nbsp;Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide) are villainous characters, clerics who serve Anubis or Nephthys&nbsp;need not be.</p>\n<h3 id=\"TheNorsePantheon\" data-content-chunk-id=\"1b957c5a-18b4-46c4-a07f-fb7940bc9a66\">The Norse Pantheon</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7c73df05-3b02-4b9e-9b88-dffd8ecb0f1c\">Where the land plummets from the snowy hills into the icy fjords below, where the longboats draw up on to the beach, where the glaciers flow forward and retreat with every fall and spring&mdash;this is the land of&nbsp;the Vikings,&nbsp;the home of the Norse pantheon. It&rsquo;s a brutal clime,&nbsp;and one that calls for brutal living. The warriors of the land have had to adapt to the harsh conditions in order to survive, but they haven&rsquo;t been too twisted by the needs of their environment. Given the necessity of raiding for food and wealth, it&rsquo;s surprising the mortals turned out as well as they did. Their powers reflect the need these warriors had for strong leadership and decisive action. Thus, they see their deities in every bend of a river, hear them in the crash of the thunder and the booming of the glaciers, and smell them in the smoke of a burning longhouse.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"450a48ab-9120-4d03-be47-b2880884bfa8\">The Norse pantheon includes two main families, the Aesir (deities of war and destiny) and the Vanir (gods of fertility and prosperity). Once enemies, these two families are now closely allied against their common enemies, the giants (including the gods Surtur and Thrym). Like the gods of Greyhawk, gods in different families sometimes have overlap in their spheres of influence: Frey (of the Vanir) and Odur (of the Aesir)<br />are both associated with the sun,&nbsp;for example.</p>\n<h4 id=\"CelticDeities\" data-content-chunk-id=\"2a798241-746a-444b-a716-155aca3555d3\">Celtic Deities</h4>\n<div>\n<table

When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"fd96755a-c2c4-49d0-904e-e51e4deacf5c\">If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don't roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"77208b2f-f92b-4486-a9d2-5b54ad1f3242\">If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6ab4306f-142b-47f1-adf4-e493adb25d7b\">When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling's Lucky trait, lets you reroll or replace the d20, you can reroll or replace only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"21827825-ddfa-459d-8f93-643cedbe388b\">You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration can also give a character advantage. The DM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.</p>","_id":"OTwoaoc2FVIqUGRF"}

{"name":"Beyond 1st Level","permission":{"default":0,"s7gxOGja1p9WAX4j":3},"flags":{},"content":"<h2 id=\"Beyond1stLevel\" data-content-chunk-id=\"aa6bb439-190f-4483-9045-8e6f62406d0b\">Beyond 1st Level</h2>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"462bfe3a-84dd-49f3-9aed-6b18648f42ff\">As your character goes on adventures and overcomes challenges, he or she gains experience, represented by experience points. A character who reaches a specified experience point total advances in capability. This advancement is called&nbsp;gaining a level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ClassFeaturesandHitDice\" data-content-chunk-id=\"650b00ca-1c89-49ac-bff0-01763b2aaa0b\">Class Features and Hit Dice</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2ad3dcab-b080-4ee9-a4d4-adab373f4a1c\">When your character gains a level, his or her class often grants additional features, as detailed in the class description. Some of these features allow you to increase your ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one score by 2. You can&rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every character's proficiency bonus increases at certain levels.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5c6b233f-5d7c-4426-a789-bfa85826a2c2\">Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total (minimum of 1) to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry, which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up).</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f51df42c-83a6-407c-8fc0-5c8120a000a8\">When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, if your 7th-level fighter has a Constitution score of 17, when he reaches 8th level, he increases his Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to +4. His hit point maximum then increases by 8.</p>\n<h3 id=\"XPandProficiencyBonusProgression\" data-content-chunk-id=\"8d12d0a3-ba95-4444-9757-6d57a214da1e\">XP and Proficiency Bonus&nbsp;Progression</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"890d7538-47d9-4bf5-b435-cb44a26237ac\">The Character Advancement table summarizes the XP you need to advance in levels from level 1 through level 20, and the proficiency bonus for a character of that level. Consult the information in your character's class description to see what other improvements you gain at each level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"TiersofPlay\" data-content-chunk-id=\"5cda0987-83b9-4e24-972f-711784de7d0c\">Tiers of Play</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"377f82e7-5714-42f8-a040-58c72e220870\">The shading in the Character Advancement table shows the four tiers of play. The tiers don&rsquo;t have any rules associated with them; they are a general description of how the play experience changes as characters&nbsp;gain levels.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"377f82e7-5714-42f8-a040-58c72e220870\"><a href=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/4/973/102.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/4/973/380/426/102.png\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"888ff804-b81b-4cc5-8e28-061b254b4500\">In the&nbsp;first tier&nbsp;(levels 1&ndash;4), characters are effectively apprentice adventurers. They are learning the features that define them as members of particular classes, including the major choices that flavor their class features as they advance (such as a wizard&rsquo;s Arcane Tradition or a fighter&rsquo;s Martial Archetype). The threats they face are relatively minor, usually posing a danger to local farmsteads&nbsp;or villages.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5985c5db-03b8-4030-8145-55b385b59998\">In the&nbsp;second tier&nbsp;(levels 5&ndash;10), characters come into their own. Many spellcasters gain access to 3rd-level spells at the start of this tier, crossing a new threshold of magical power with spells such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fireball\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2102-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">fireball</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/lightning-bolt\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2167-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">lightning bolt</a>. At this tier, many weapon-using classes gain the ability to make multiple attacks in one round. These characters have become important, facing dangers that threaten cities&nbsp;and kingdoms.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"806dc4de-7d49-4b5f-b8e4-9b415c24ea27\">In the&nbsp;third tier&nbsp;(levels 11&ndash;16), characters have reached a level of power that sets them high above the ordinary populace and makes them special even among adventurers. At 11th level, many spellcasters gain access to 6th-level spells, some of which create effects previously impossible for player characters to achieve.

{"name":"Evaluating Encounter Difficulty","permission":{"default":0,"s7gxOGja1p9WAX4j":3},"flags":{},"content":"<h2 id=\"EvaluatingEncounterDifficulty\">Evaluating Encounter Difficulty</h2>\n<p>Use the following method to gauge the difficulty of any combat encounter.</p>\n<p>1. Determine XP Thresholds.&nbsp;First, determine the experience point (XP) thresholds for each character in the party. The XP Thresholds by Character Level table has four XP thresholds for each character level, one for each category of encounter difficulty. Use a character&rsquo;s level to determine his or her XP thresholds. Repeat this process for every character in the party.</p>\n<p>2. Determine the Party&rsquo;s XP Threshold.&nbsp;For each category of encounter difficulty, add up the characters&rsquo; XP thresholds. This determines the party&rsquo;s XP threshold. You&rsquo;ll end up with four totals, one for each category of encounter difficulty.</p>\n<p>For example, if your party includes three 3rd-level characters and one 2nd-level character, the party&rsquo;s totaled XP thresholds would be as follows:</p>\n<p>Easy:&nbsp;275 XP (75 + 75 + 75 + 50)</p>\n<p>Medium:&nbsp;550 XP (150 + 150 + 150 + 100)</p>\n<p>Hard:&nbsp;825 XP (225 + 225 + 225 + 150)</p>\n<p>Deadly:&nbsp;1,400 XP (400 + 400 + 400 + 200)</p>\n<p>Record the totals, because you can use them for every encounter in your adventure.</p>\n<p>3. Total the Monsters&rsquo; XP.&nbsp;Add up the XP for all of the monsters in the encounter. Every monster has an XP value in its stat block.</p>\n<p>4. Modify Total XP for Multiple Monsters.&nbsp;If the encounter includes more than one monster, apply a multiplier to the monsters&rsquo; total XP. The more monsters there are, the more attack rolls you&rsquo;re making against the characters in a given round, and the more dangerous the encounter becomes. To correctly gauge an encounter&rsquo;s difficulty, multiply the total XP of all the monsters in the encounter by the value given in the Encounter Multipliers table.</p>\n<p>For example, if an encounter includes four monsters worth a total of 500 XP, you would multiply the total XP of the monsters by 2, for an adjusted value of 1,000 XP. This adjusted value is not what the monsters are worth in terms of XP; the adjusted value&rsquo;s only purpose is to help you accurately assess the encounter&rsquo;s difficulty.</p>\n<p>When making this calculation, don&rsquo;t count any monsters whose challenge rating is significantly below the average challenge rating of the other monsters in the group unless you think the weak monsters significantly contribute to the difficulty of the encounter.</p>\n<div>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Number of Monsters</th>\n<th>Multiplier</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>&times; 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>&times; 1.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3&ndash;6</td>\n<td>&times; 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7-10</td>\n<td>x 2.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11-14</td>\n<td>x 3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15 or more</td>\n<td>x 4</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5. Compare XP.&nbsp;Compare the monsters&rsquo; adjusted XP value to the party&rsquo;s XP thresholds. The closest threshold that is lower than the adjusted XP value of the monsters determines the encounter&rsquo;s difficulty.</p>\n<p>For example, an encounter with one bugbear and three hobgoblins has an adjusted XP value of 1,000, making it a hard encounter for a party of three 3rd-level characters and one 2nd-level character (which has a hard encounter threshold of 825 XP and a deadly encounter threshold of 1,400 XP).</p>\n<div>\n<h4 id=\"ChallengeRating\">Challenge Rating</h4>\n<p>When putting together an encounter or adventure, especially at lower levels, exercise caution when using monsters whose challenge rating is higher than the party&rsquo;s average level. Such a creature might deal enough damage with a single action to take out adventurers of a lower level. For example, an ogre has a challenge rating of 2, but it can kill a 1st-level wizard with a single blow.</p>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"PartySize\">Party Size</h4>\n<p>The preceding guidelines assume that you have a party consisting of three to five adventurers.</p>\n<p>If the party contains fewer than three characters, apply the next highest multiplier on the Encounter Multipliers table. For example, apply a multiplier of 1.5 when the characters fight a single monster, and a multiplier of 5 for groups of fifteen or more monsters.</p>\n<p>If the party contains six or more characters, use the next lowest multiplier on the table. Use a multiplier of 0.5 for a single monster.</p>\n<h4 id=\"MultipartEncounters\">Multipart Encounters</h4>\n<p>Sometimes an encounter features multiple enemies that the party doesn&rsquo;t face all at once. For example, monsters might come at the party in waves. For such encounters, treat each discrete part or wave as a separate encounter for the purpose of determining its difficulty.</p>\n<p>A party can&rsquo;t benefit from a short rest between parts of a multipart encounter, so they won&rsquo;t be able to spend Hit Dice to regain hit points or recover any abilities that require a short rest to regain. As a rule, if the adjusted XP value for the monsters in a multipart encounter is higher than one-third of the party&rsquo;s expected XP total for the adventuring day (see &ldquo;The Adventuring Day,&rdquo; below), the encounter is going to be tougher than the sum of its parts.</p>\n<h4 id=\"BuildingEncountersonaBudget\">Building Encounters on a Budget</h4>\n<p>You can build an encounter if you know its desired difficulty. The party&rsquo;s XP thresholds give you an XP budget that you can spend on monsters to build easy, medium, hard, and deadly encounters. Just remember that groups of monsters eat up more of that budget than their base XP values would indicate (see step 4).</p>\n<p>For example, using the party from step 2, you can build a medium encounter by making sure that the adjusted XP value of the monsters is at least 550 XP (the party&rsquo;s threshold for a medium encounter) and no more than 825 XP (the party&rsquo;s threshold for a hard encounter). A single monster of challenge rating 3 (such as a manticore or owlbear) is worth 700 XP, so that&rsquo;s one possibility. If you want a pair of monsters, each one will count for 1.5 times its base XP value. A pair of dire wolves (worth 200 XP each) have an adjusted XP value of 600, making them a medium encounter for the party as well.</p>\n<p>To assist with this approach, the&nbsp;Monster Manual&nbsp;presents a list of all monsters organized by challenge rating.</p>\n<h4 id=\"TheAdventuringDay\">The Adventuring Day</h4>\n<p>Assuming typical adventuring conditions and average luck, most adventuring parties can handle about six to eight medium or hard encounters in a day. If the adventure has more easy encounters, the adventurers can get through more. If it has more deadly encounters, they can handle fewer.</p>\n<p>In the same way you figure out the difficulty of an encounter, you can use the XP values of monsters and other opponents in an adventure as a guideline for how far the party is likely to progress.</p>\n<p>For each character in the party, use the Adventuring Day XP table to estimate how much XP that character is expected to earn in a day. Add together the values of all party members to get a total for the party&rsquo;s adventuring day. This provides a rough estimate of the adjusted XP value for encounters the party can handle before the characters will need to take a long rest.</p>\n<h4 id=\"AdventuringDayXP\">Adventuring Day XP</h4>\n<div>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Level</th>\n<th>Adjusted XP per Day per Character</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>300</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>600</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>1,200</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>1,700</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>3,500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>4,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>5,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>6,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>7,500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>9,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11th</td>\n<td>10,500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12th</td>\n<td>11,500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th</td>\n<td>13,500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>15,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15th</td>\n<td>18,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16th</td>\n<td>20,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>25,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18th</td>\n<td>27,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19th</td>\n<td>30,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20th</td>\n<td>40,000</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"ShortRests\">Short Rests</h4>\n<p>In general, over the course of a full adventuring day, the party will likely need to take two short rests, about one-third and two-thirds of the way through the day.</p>","_id":"PgkBzDqlKzBUZTPM"}

You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"52ea1a3d-d060-4bd8-ab81-c984ba2c7c97\">You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast.

You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard&rsquo;s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0e02e679-bb77-476d-877e-bd0c443e5fb5\">Copying a Spell into the Book.&nbsp;When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"fd59f18b-57af-4a5f-86a5-7e1ba458b5de\">Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0db0ff37-bcae-4352-b9b0-3a25762b3c16\">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9473f2e5-0a39-483c-b5f2-14375efd3947\">Replacing the Book.&nbsp;You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9644d5a9-38ad-4066-a361-5e7a4012b1f8\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1ff5e53e-a36e-465e-b870-212af67c6c0c\">The Book&rsquo;s Appearance.&nbsp;Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"ArcaneRecovery\" data-content-chunk-id=\"1514b802-fc96-47a7-92e6-c530deba1294\">Arcane Recovery</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8856282c-ba28-43c5-a173-19e72913d03b\">You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a0d6de97-2cd7-4e39-b9da-50511c3cc1c8\">For example, if you&rsquo;re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ArcaneTradition\" data-content-chunk-id=\"a106b70c-457a-47aa-baa0-b250288f3a91\">Arcane Tradition</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e6a4d601-c3a1-4ce3-890d-d72a6d6d65ad\">When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation, all detailed at the end of the class description.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0f91b96f-0191-46f9-8fcc-e6a37594b806\">Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"WizardAbilityScoreImprovement\" data-content-chunk-id=\"2ed15526-4412-4a25-b360-7ec17f7709b5\">Ability Score Improvement</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"56ca9c39-9e50-46f7-83e8-e4ae9e8eaa7b\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can&rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<h3 id=\"SpellMastery\" data-content-chunk-id=\"862d5799-e3ce-4c5c-aec6-349b2d4fc0c7\">Spell Mastery</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b2e53b14-0ad8-4391-82ae-3306156dc7fa\">At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"748a964d-7bc3-4d1c-9323-b4756d183117\">By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.</p>\n<h3 id=\"SignatureSpells\" data-content-chunk-id=\"c4652d2e-3b67-4cf4-9e37-ce8fceb0f9f6\">Signature Spells</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"123918d6-c6c1-4024-9094-fcb48937360c\">When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don&rsquo;t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can&rsquo;t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d06ca926-af7b-4f92-bd83-30e9a9a5de55\">If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ArcaneTraditions\" data-content-chunk-id=\"efb32c5a-eea4-415b-b916-edc7c684abce\">Arcane Traditions</h2>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c2c826f8-1a37-4125-82fe-5b1cb8218d61\"><a href=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/719/c3wizard2.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/719/300/357/c3wizard2.png\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"46220528-7d85-477c-996a-92321521a858\">The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in the worlds of D&amp;D, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3da61c4a-189d-4414-850f-af7f770161f7\">The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools, as described in&nbsp;<a title=\"Spellcasting\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\" data-content-chunk-id=\"a0ef18e7-d259-44f2-9188-4623a2ac1471\">chapter 10</a>. In some places, these traditions are literally schools; a wizard might study at the School of Illusion while another studies across town at the School of Enchantment. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h3 id=\"SchoolofEvocation\" data-content-chunk-id=\"7c113b22-2611-4ffe-a767-2c0ce3ba7808\">School of Evocation</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6018b9e9-95b6-43be-bdef-f907d4c5a88c\"><a href=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/4/977/105.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/4/977/480/732/105.png\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"01884828-d2e9-4c0a-b6ad-9dc9af71c4c2\">You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h4 id=\"EvocationSavant\" data-content-chunk-id=\"1c84b42a-2b8e-4cb7-8690-430e56b0d8b8\">Evocation Savant</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"fc15b4d6-42ce-426a-bd7b-8a5db3762341\">Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.</p>\n<h4 id=\"SculptSpells\" data-content-chunk-id=\"a21dfc20-c8b1-41fd-827b-1b53516f4983\">Sculpt Spells</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0a03e673-2096-459f-8527-922bf2b6e422\">Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell&rsquo;s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.</p>\n<h4 id=\"PotentCantrip\" data-content-chunk-id=\"82b92668-d253-4b6c-b94a-209e6a491625\">Potent Cantrip</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d628eafd-a8f1-492c-a18c-7c44fc87dc7d\">Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip&rsquo;s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.</p>\n<h4 id=\"EmpoweredEvocation\" data-content-chunk-id=\"aabd106c-6bc3-4e6b-a840-4dd593fda1fe\">Empowered Evocation</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"edf6fbd6-3475-4c11-8ed9-8153c308d032\">Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Overchannel\" data-content-chunk-id=\"4e061480-7ca7-4e4a-a48a-8b678d081668\">Overchannel</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a11a2f83-0e39-4e24-be26-0aad8b939564\">Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b537a12f-b3ed-4240-bdd1-6881e355e0d0\">The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.</p>","_id":"PxVrsTB6LtR1DdYJ"}

Even in a fantastical world, people require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and clothing. These things cost money, although some lifestyles cost more than others.</p>\n<h3 id=\"LifestyleExpenses\" data-content-chunk-id=\"1819fe37-8107-4680-a94d-9d92948c1f59\">Lifestyle Expenses</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e6378d5f-dde4-452e-bfc4-3c5f53706ecf\">Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover your accommodations, food and drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when adventure next calls.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"72805683-b6c7-4576-8456-eaac164224ea\">At the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your character's career.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"db03fc33-ca39-4b2f-a88b-57ef6b6e6d14\">Your lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections.</p>\n<div>\n<table id=\"expenseslifestyle\" data-content-chunk-id=\"af346028-dcf8-4277-80ee-b7d87bfb3f10\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Lifestyle</th>\n<th align=\"right\">Price/Day</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Wretched</td>\n<td align=\"right\">-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Squalid</td>\n<td align=\"right\">1 sp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Poor</td>\n<td align=\"right\">2 sp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Modest</td>\n<td align=\"right\">1 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Comfortable</td>\n<td align=\"right\">2 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wealthy</td>\n<td align=\"right\">4 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Aristocratic</td>\n<td align=\"right\">10 gp minimum</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c169d502-6cd0-46ef-b15e-71bda7d2ee70\"><br />Wretched.&nbsp;You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6a65b9d4-904e-4083-95cd-66e3fcd2644d\">Squalid.&nbsp;You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ef2cd957-11a3-4893-b5d7-2f58cdeed24c\">Poor.&nbsp;A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"bccfe6cb-bc2c-446a-af72-40d7fd001a83\">Modest.&nbsp;A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don't go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, and the like.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5dce6efa-155e-44a8-998f-124cac87597a\">Comfortable.&nbsp;Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a small cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military officers.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"55c02f5d-15c0-4f13-a941-ce2909509378\">Wealthy.&nbsp;Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1a055733-5113-474b-b89c-2609e7baa74b\">Aristocratic.&nbsp;You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, and nobility. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.</p>\n<blockquote data-content-chunk-id=\"4fb6b945-19b1-4813-be72-e2a7daec994b\">\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2608a697-0938-4b92-adfd-578c18e8a4bb\">SELF SUFFICIENCY</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"fafe0b2a-457d-4dbd-ac15-7614c5250251\">The expenses and lifestyles described here assume that you are spending your time between adventures in town, availing yourself of whatever services you can afford--paying for food and shelter, paying townspeople to sharpen your sword and repair your armor, and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9dab04d9-b758-4a29-b6e6-70239743302d\">Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn't require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your time between adventures practicing a profession, you can eke out the equivalent of a poor lifestyle.

Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"44c06e49-0732-42da-a3e4-935f087a72ed\">Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, a wizard might pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in the secret chest spell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming performance in front of the duke.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ac2525fd-c234-415b-8203-a116323d9512\">Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the stables clean.

It might be possible to find someone willing to cast a spell in exchange for coin or favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay rates exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired spell, the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the more it costs.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"653b6664-7c8a-4d56-828d-a802749632c5\">Hiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of 1st or 2nd level, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cure-wounds\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2056-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">cure wounds</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/identify\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2152-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">identify</a>, is easy enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material components). Finding someone able and willing to cast a higher-level spell might involve traveling to a large city, perhaps one with a university or prominent temple. Once found, the spellcaster might ask for a service instead of payment -- the kind of service that only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous locale or traversing a monster-infested wilderness to deliver something important to a distant settlement.</p>","_id":"Qa7USjccUbd8V1uP"}

Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher- level spells are even more so. Thus, each spellcasting class's description (except that of the warlock) includes a table showing how many spell slots of each spell level a character can use at each character level. For example, the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level slots.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5fae6f16-a832-4fb3-b7f7-e6e0e7e11056\">When a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that spell's level or higher, effectively \"filling\" a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size--small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level slot. So when Umara casts&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/magic-missile\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2176-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">magic missile</a>, a 1st-level spell, she spends one of her four 1st-level slots and has three remaining.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"596f746b-b6d4-4161-9a68-7e2b46442d0e\">Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"18f6ce4c-180d-492c-9f76-c0ad5e105a4f\">Some characters and monsters have special abilities that let them cast spells without using spell slots. For example, a monk who follows the Way of the Four Elements, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast spells in such a way.</p>","_id":"SWOvO5T7EWTT8Orm"}

They&rsquo;re individuals with their own stories, interests, connections, and capabilities beyond those that class and race define.

Consider the following two human fighters.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"80b01530-b60a-4a5f-bfed-08c02f062e4c\">Hailing from the Dragonlance setting, Tika Waylan was a brash teenager who had a rough childhood. The daughter of a thief, she ran away from home and practiced her father&rsquo;s trade on the streets of Solace. When she tried to rob the proprietor of the Inn of the Last Home, he caught her and took her under his wing, giving her a job as a barmaid. But when the dragonarmies laid waste to the town of Solace and destroyed the inn, necessity forced Tika into adventure alongside the friends she&rsquo;d known from her childhood. Her skill as a fighter (a frying pan remains one of her favorite weapons) combined with her history on the streets gave her skills invaluable in her adventuring career.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9c29eb2c-4094-4ce5-a0dd-5d79101bd7e2\">Artemis Entreri grew up on the streets of Calimport in the Forgotten Realms. He used his wits, strength, and agility to carve out his own territory in one of the city&rsquo;s hundreds of poor shanty towns. After several years, he attracted the notice of one of the most powerful thieves&rsquo; guilds in the city, and he ascended the ranks of the guild quickly despite his youth. Artemis became the favored assassin of one of the city&rsquo;s pashas, who sent him to far-off Icewind Dale to recover some stolen gems. He&rsquo;s a professional killer, constantly challenging himself to improve his skills.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1fd07ccb-4cc2-4bf6-a319-e67a9389eb57\">Tika and Artemis are both human and both fighters (with some experience as rogues), possessing similarly high Strength and Dexterity scores, but there the similarity ends.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"Name\" data-content-chunk-id=\"413e8412-0840-4e7b-907e-ae03cadd1840\">Name</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5dbee74e-4e84-4cac-8ced-d4696d5dac8d\">Your character&rsquo;s race description includes sample names for members of that race.

Think about how your character does or does not conform to the broader culture&rsquo;s expectations of sex, gender, and sexual behavior. For example, a male drow cleric defies the traditional gender divisions of drow society, which could be a reason for your character to leave that society and come to the surface.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b02d8ce2-85b0-4398-bbae-94a9ade421ec\">You don&rsquo;t need to be confined to binary notions of sex and gender. The elf god Corellon Larethian is often seen as androgynous, for example, and some elves in the multiverse are made in Corellon&rsquo;s image. You could also play a female character who presents herself as a man, a man who feels trapped in a female body, or a bearded female dwarf who hates being mistaken for a male. Likewise, your character&rsquo;s sexual orientation is for you to decide.</p>\n<h4 id=\"HeightandWeight\" data-content-chunk-id=\"f67860dd-1582-4fe4-8900-ffff77c2ac91\">Height and Weight</h4>\n<div>\n<table data-content-chunk-id=\"764c461a-d3bc-4ffe-9847-40f9e0c2933f\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Race</th>\n<th>Base<br />Height</th>\n<th>Height<br />Modifier</th>\n<th>Base<br />Weight</th>\n<th>Weight<br />Modifier</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Human</td>\n<td>4'8\"</td>\n<td>+2d10</td>\n<td>110 lb.</td>\n<td>&times; (2d4) lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dwarf, hill</td>\n<td>3'8\"</td>\n<td>+2d4</td>\n<td>115 lb.</td>\n<td>&times; (2d6) lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dwarf, mountain</td>\n<td>4'</td>\n<td>+2d4</td>\n<td>130 lb.</td>\n<td>&times; (2d6) lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Elf, high</td>\n<td>4'6\"</td>\n<td>+2d10</td>\n<td>90 lb.</td>\n<td>&times; (1d4) lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Elf, wood</td>\n<td>4'6\"</td>\n<td>+2d10</td>\n<td>100 lb.</td>\n<td>&times; (1d4) lb.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Halfling</td>\n<td>2'7\"</td>\n<td>+2d4</td>\n<td>35 lb.</td>\n<td>&times; 1 lb.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"247ca2d6-0057-4676-b800-3a81c3df0b6f\"><br />You can decide your character&rsquo;s height and weight, using the information provided in your race description or on the Random Height and Weight table. Think about what your character&rsquo;s ability scores might say about his or her height and weight. A weak but agile character might be thin. A strong and tough character might be tall or just heavy.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"63306c81-d91f-4f40-ae00-7f19af4ed7d8\">If you want to, you can roll randomly for your character&rsquo;s height and weight using the Random Height and Weight table. The dice roll given in the Height Modifier column determines the character&rsquo;s extra height (in inches) beyond the base height. That same number multiplied by the dice roll or quantity given in the Weight Modifier column determines the character&rsquo;s extra weight (in pounds) beyond the base weight.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"72e9edee-95a1-4808-be00-651cdfdcae25\">For example, as a human, Tika has a height of 4 feet 8 inches plus 2d10 inches. Her player rolls 2d10 and gets a total of 12, so Tika stands 5 feet 8 inches tall. Then the player uses that same roll of 12 and multiplies it by 2d4 pounds. Her 2d4 roll is 3, so Tika weighs an extra 36 pounds (12 x 3) on top of her base 110 pounds, for a total of 146 pounds.</p>\n<h3 id=\"OtherPhysicalCharacteristics\" data-content-chunk-id=\"eaf4e33d-c7a3-4768-9800-ea593e012dd8\">Other Physical Characteristics</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"82077d91-ebe4-45a7-aa40-e3934f04f198\">You choose your character&rsquo;s age and the color of his or her hair, eyes, and skin.

Artemis is a small man, compact and all wiry muscle. He has angular features and high cheekbones, and he always seems in need of a shave.

data-content-chunk-id=\"b1e8cc36-5c28-495c-b989-977f77e519f2\">Weapon Proficiency</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2f3641b1-9f58-41af-85d2-fd35626d219a\">Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are&nbsp;simple&nbsp;and&nbsp;martial. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d45cc4ba-c5a1-4b77-9bdb-4dccedf78fb2\">Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.</p>\n<h3 id=\"WeaponProperties\" data-content-chunk-id=\"4c93c005-bee8-49b9-9948-c95f1bc11d93\">Weapon Properties</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"feb04173-8ad3-4e70-8138-bcfd3fd49358\">Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"efb1c79a-5a4f-4e91-bcc6-4b6091eae365\">Ammunition.&nbsp;You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7e14859f-6f2b-4485-bbfa-37cf1b384b9e\">If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see \"Improvised Weapons\" later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"638b1cfd-666b-4ea2-99f5-15dd1152fc97\">Finesse.&nbsp;When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0e93700c-ea47-4169-bbfe-2eaa09ca65ce\">Heavy.&nbsp;Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for&nbsp;a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1cdd4c1f-e561-4f45-acbc-d28818131d70\">Light.&nbsp;A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"79a65a73-8d34-4e93-bfc0-ffbcae67389c\">Loading.&nbsp;Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b2d7d573-6ae5-4c22-8910-946bc7e06f39\">Range.&nbsp;A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c528bd6f-64fd-456c-83e5-fc09271161d2\">Reach.&nbsp;This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b040f996-e493-4f30-ad55-3fff8686bb4a\">Special.&nbsp;A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon's description (see \"Special Weapons\" later in this section).</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"de5be818-eb5f-4196-b902-c78cb0b20cac\">Thrown.&nbsp;If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b9bbd9c5-c332-432d-a8f7-37453560da74\">Two-Handed.&nbsp;This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"62efaf57-8141-43c2-ae94-9579308bf15e\">Versatile.&nbsp;This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property--the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ImprovisedWeapons\" data-content-chunk-id=\"1ce52834-f00c-4909-b2cd-667cadd8e20a\">Improvised Weapons</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2c45639c-0dd4-4e12-a51d-96e5dc01d27f\">Sometimes characters don't have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1893df5b-3cf8-4a4a-ab52-882d09a1a6e9\">Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the DM's option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"21dd23cc-b71b-467c-8e72-fd21c1cb6e83\">An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the DM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.</p>\n<h3 id=\"SilveredWeapons\" data-content-chunk-id=\"69287c71-ac4f-4ab9-a1ac-688e5f67a3bd\">Silvered Weapons</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"34d48dc6-4862-42d5-b2a3-ecf32ae0ba70\">Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.</p>\n<h3 id=\"SpecialWeapons\" data-content-chunk-id=\"cc7e6e87-304c-46e0-bd97-748ad324490e\">Special Weapons</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"efae8894-4564-4aac-9d00-bdb6993ee5d3\">Weapons with special rules are described here.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"282161c0-9039-4557-bcdd-c8580c17649b\">Lance.&nbsp;You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"fe70673b-5ab1-4a24-b690-00c51f522116\">Net.&nbsp;A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/13-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">restrained</a>&nbsp;until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2e8b9afd-d483-439e-b01f-9fc2efed3e39\">When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.</p>","_id":"T1jYtAqLmu3dCoH6"}

One wrong step in an ancient tomb might trigger a series of scything blades, which cleave through armor and bone. The seemingly innocuous vines that hang over a cave entrance might grasp and choke anyone who pushes through them. A net hidden among the trees might drop on travelers who pass underneath. In a fantasy game, unwary adventurers can fall to their deaths, be burned alive, or fall under a fusillade of poisoned darts.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9e099792-6b05-45ba-8b29-07046f5dd911\">A trap can be either mechanical or magical in nature.&nbsp;Mechanical traps&nbsp;include pits, arrow traps, falling blocks, water-filled rooms, whirling blades, and anything else that depends on a mechanism to operate.&nbsp;Magic traps&nbsp;are either magical device traps or spell traps. Magical device traps initiate spell effects when activated. Spell traps are spells such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/glyph-of-warding\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2125-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">glyph of warding</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/symbol\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2272-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">symbol</a>&nbsp;that function as traps.</p>\n<h3 id=\"TrapsinPlay\" data-content-chunk-id=\"67057b5d-6b47-4ac8-a719-eddbdca72d4d\">Traps in Play</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1afede99-cbcc-446b-b042-79fa4e0e96ec\">When adventurers come across a trap, you need to know how the trap is triggered and what it does, as well as the possibility for the characters to detect the trap and to disable or avoid it.</p>\n<h4 id=\"TriggeringaTrap\" data-content-chunk-id=\"6162318f-d399-4cfd-9537-8323b66870d0\">Triggering a Trap</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d721caf0-c63d-45f1-bc65-75b500706c48\">Most traps are triggered when a creature goes somewhere or touches something that the trap's creator wanted to protect. Common triggers include stepping on a pressure plate or a false section of floor, pulling a trip wire, turning a doorknob, and using the wrong key in a lock. Magic traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area or touches an object. Some magic traps (such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/glyph-of-warding\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2125-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">glyph of warding</a>&nbsp;spell) have more complicated trigger conditions, including a password that prevents the trap from activating.</p>\n<h4 id=\"DetectingandDisablingaTrap\" data-content-chunk-id=\"02c1b87c-9151-454a-9cab-9f5eb6fdd556\">Detecting and Disabling a Trap</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"83451a82-0833-4a18-a3a0-03dac27e2d30\">Usually, some element of a trap is visible to careful inspection. Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something that points to a trap's presence.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1f74f9b8-353e-4f25-9404-27bfe1314aab\">A trap's description specifies the checks and DCs needed to detect it, disable it, or both. A character actively looking for a trap can attempt a Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/14-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Perception</a>) check against the trap's DC. You can also compare the DC to detect the trap with each character's passive Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/14-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Perception</a>) score to determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they might be able to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to move past it. You might call for an Intelligence (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Investigation\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/8-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Investigation</a>) check for a character to deduce what needs to be done, followed by a Dexterity check using thieves' tools to perform the necessary sabotage.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e6330e6a-cdcb-4e31-8fab-ddf984687567\">Any character can attempt an Intelligence (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Arcana\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/6-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Arcana</a>) check to detect or disarm a magic trap, in addition to any other checks noted in the trap's description. The DCs are the same regardless of the check used. In addition,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2072-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">dispel magic</a>&nbsp;has a chance of disabling most magic traps. A magic trap's description provides the DC for the ability check made when you use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2072-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">dispel magic</a>.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c6f3643a-f3bf-4103-9213-2b9064c858ce\">In most cases, a trap's description is clear enough that you can adjudicate whether a character's actions locate or foil the trap. As with many situations, you shouldn't allow die rolling to override clever play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the trap's description to determine what happens. No trap's design can anticipate every possible action that the characters might attempt.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"de1fea76-aba3-4bd6-9767-9017922b2915\">You should allow a character to discover a trap without making an ability check if an action would clearly reveal the trap's presence. For example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the character has found the trigger and no check is required.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"fa5c3673-78d6-4997-8158-4a3c1d5ec28b\">Foiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it's trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the shield.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"fc2f94f5-4953-4e69-95aa-cdfe1e9f069b\">Traps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those traps without harming themselves. Such traps might have hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that goes around the trap.</p>\n<h4 id=\"TrapEffects\" data-content-chunk-id=\"5f1b6b3f-7522-41bd-b591-17e21e0acbe2\">Trap Effects</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8b1cc017-a40d-4c86-81ad-2ddfa7dfd033\">The effects of traps can range from inconvenient to deadly, making use of elements such as arrows, spikes, blades, poison, toxic gas, blasts of fire, and deep pits. The deadliest traps combine multiple elements to kill, injure, contain, or drive off any creature unfortunate enough to trigger them. A trap's description specifies what happens when it is triggered.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"39af396c-5227-4f5b-b811-f00724d4bcd4\">The attack bonus of a trap, the save DC to resist its effects, and the damage it deals can vary depending on the trap's severity. Use the Trap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses table and the Damage Severity by Level table for suggestions based on three levels of trap severity.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9fd97a52-f3df-4722-818a-037653ad7e7a\">A trap intended to be a&nbsp;setback&nbsp;is unlikely to kill or seriously harm characters of the indicated levels, whereas a&nbsp;dangerous&nbsp;trap is likely to seriously injure (and potentially kill) characters of the indicated levels. A&nbsp;deadly&nbsp;trap is likely to kill characters of the indicated levels.</p>\n<h5 id=\"TrapSaveDCsandAttackBonuses\" data-content-chunk-id=\"9d0366c9-4638-4370-bea2-60bf43c97f36\">Trap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses</h5>\n<div>\n<table data-content-chunk-id=\"702e9f3a-a419-4aba-9ed4-7f7644d0aaa1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Trap Danger</th>\n<th>Save DC</th>\n<th>Attack Bonus</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Setback</td>\n<td>10-11</td>\n<td>+3 to +5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dangerous</td>\n<td>12-15</td>\n<td>+6 to +8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Deadly</td>\n<td>16-20</td>\n<td>+9 to +12</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h5 id=\"DamageSeveritybyLevel\" data-content-chunk-id=\"a467bb8e-ce0f-409e-8c00-8139cf18e0b6\">Damage Severity by Level</h5>\n<div>\n<table data-content-chunk-id=\"34d4e9ce-c3f1-4a2f-8682-56d94394e236\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Character Level</th>\n<th>Setback</th>\n<th>Dangerous</th>\n<th>Deadly</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1st-4th</td>\n<td>1d10</td>\n<td>2d10</td>\n<td>4d10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th-10th</td>\n<td>2d10</td>\n<td>4d10</td>\n<td>10d10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11th-16th</td>\n<td>4d10</td>\n<td>10d10</td>\n<td>18d10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th-20th</td>\n<td>10d10</td>\n<td>18d10</td>\n<td>24d10</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"ComplexTraps\" data-content-chunk-id=\"785024e6-a6a0-478d-87df-82ef042984bb\">Complex Traps</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"29d9c4f6-1896-40b4-9dbb-5ff4d8896117\">Complex traps work like standard traps, except once activated they execute a series of actions each round. A complex trap turns the process of dealing with a trap into something more like a combat encounter.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f2c32c7d-11f2-4615-bf1c-e9429e58374e\">When a complex trap activates, it rolls initiative. The trap's description includes an initiative bonus. On its turn, the trap activates again, often taking an action. It might make successive attacks against intruders, create an effect that changes over time, or otherwise produce a dynamic challenge. Otherwise, the complex trap can be detected and disabled or bypassed in the usual ways.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"42641171-52ca-4cfc-b3e4-ec69b610f6ed\">For example, a trap that causes a room to slowly flood works best as a complex trap. On the trap's turn, the water level rises. After several rounds, the room is completely flooded.</p>\n<h3 id=\"SampleTraps\" data-content-chunk-id=\"d911d3c8-75e8-47ef-9e49-84010e028f08\">Sample Traps</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"81bafaba-907b-498a-8cc8-7dd028cc7063\">The magical and mechanical traps presented here vary in deadliness and are presented in alphabetical order.</p>\n<h5 id=\"CollapsingRoof\" data-content-chunk-id=\"5df91b09-dee0-46f4-bfd7-fa21d4c5018b\">Collapsing Roof</h5>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"259ff7b9-ae89-4d25-b6a6-bf6a89be6a29\">Mechanical trap</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"01f31996-be5b-41b3-8faf-647e462edadb\">This trap uses a trip wire to collapse the supports keeping an unstable section of a ceiling in place.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0f651031-abac-49b0-b2d1-7ad2707a3497\">The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two support beams. The DC to spot the trip wire is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools disables the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves' tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9737e511-9195-4b75-a7e4-21e0b63f7cc5\">Anyone who inspects the beams can easily determine that they are merely wedged in place.

Any creature in the area beneath the unstable section must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once the trap is triggered, the floor of the area is filled with rubble and becomes difficult terrain.</p>\n<h5 id=\"FallingNet\" data-content-chunk-id=\"43f395c6-f378-4f42-88ac-ae511debf31b\">Falling Net</h5>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"aa2bf639-b489-48a4-abc9-2e68934aac0d\">Mechanical trap</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"237f796c-9c08-42c4-bed3-d156c4d03321\">This trap uses a trip wire to release a net suspended from the ceiling.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e4fb443f-f109-44d4-b680-b44b74789aa8\">The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two columns or trees. The net is hidden by cobwebs or foliage. The DC to spot the trip wire and net is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools breaks the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves' tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"95a8c052-12ca-44cc-9309-23bcd2ef749b\">When the trap is triggered, the net is released, covering a 10-foot-square area. Those in the area are trapped under the net and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/13-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">restrained</a>, and those that fail a DC 10 Strength saving throw are also knocked&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/12-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">prone</a>. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net has AC 10 and 20 hit points. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) destroys a 5-foot-square section of it, freeing any creature trapped in that section.</p>\n<h5 id=\"FireBreathingStatue\" data-content-chunk-id=\"d4ab3963-fddb-422f-9af3-3b21219d950f\">Fire-Breathing Statue</h5>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"484d4068-0b9b-42b5-a81c-973da6ecf567\">Magic trap</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7ad96e74-cdbf-4ef7-b74a-07c555443bb8\">This trap is activated when an intruder steps on a hidden pressure plate, releasing a magical gout of flame from a nearby statue. The statue can be of anything, including a dragon or a wizard casting a spell.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"036bcd3b-4f33-444c-b0ce-5bd6084eee73\">The DC is 15 to spot the pressure plate, as well as faint scorch marks on the floor and walls. A spell or other effect that can sense the presence of magic, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-magic\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2065-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">detect magic</a>, reveals an aura of evocation magic around the statue.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2fe49ff6-81ea-4bad-ac73-1e94d34a7100\">The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, causing the statue to release a 30-foot cone of fire. Each creature in the fire must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4085eec3-647b-4e84-9ca7-9c00e9ccd5f9\">Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating.

The hole is covered by a large cloth anchored on the pit's edge and camouflaged with dirt and debris.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c2a12725-547c-482c-9e1e-492d53259469\">The DC to spot the pit is 10. Anyone stepping on the cloth falls through and pulls the cloth down into the pit, taking damage based on the pit's depth (usually 10 feet, but some pits are deeper).</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1e48e42b-822f-45ad-928b-4ec48a8d12e7\">Hidden Pit.&nbsp;This pit has a cover constructed from material identical to the floor around it.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"cff81bdf-75e3-4c5d-b810-1b458a5c62f8\">A successful DC 15 Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/14-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Perception</a>) check discerns an absence of foot traffic over the section of floor that forms the pit's cover. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Investigation\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/8-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Investigation</a>) check is necessary to confirm that the trapped section of floor is actually the cover of a pit.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"16131d84-cd56-48e1-9281-743ec1a6a285\">When a creature steps on the cover, it swings open like a trapdoor, causing the intruder to spill into the pit below. The pit is usually 10 or 20 feet deep but can be deeper.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"02ba1eee-7f58-4955-8279-51097fd72620\">Once the pit trap is detected, an iron spike or similar object can be wedged between the pit's cover and the surrounding floor in such a way as to prevent the cover from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also be magically held shut using the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/arcane-lock\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2003-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">arcane lock</a>&nbsp;spell or similar magic.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3ec1bb8f-2fd7-4170-ac84-39d7e9d058f2\">Locking Pit.&nbsp;This pit trap is identical to a hidden pit trap, with one key exception: the trap door that covers the pit is spring-loaded. After a creature falls into the pit, the cover snaps shut to trap its victim inside.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"07065d8f-e5b7-49ed-a7bd-f1fa72b11c98\">A successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to pry the cover open. The cover can also be smashed open. A character in the pit can also attempt to disable the spring mechanism from the inside with a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, provided that the mechanism can be reached and the character can see. In some cases, a mechanism (usually hidden behind a secret door nearby) opens the pit.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"74764a3b-55b5-4634-952d-1b563fdd7d2f\">Spiked Pit.&nbsp;This pit trap is a simple, hidden, or locking pit trap with sharpened wooden or iron spikes at the bottom. A creature falling into the pit takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in addition to any falling damage. Even nastier versions have poison smeared on the spikes. In that case, anyone taking piercing damage from the spikes must also make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking an 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\n<h5 id=\"PoisonDarts\" data-content-chunk-id=\"188d911c-fbdd-4496-951f-9aeb4e6dacb6\">Poison Darts</h5>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"70ce5f4a-228f-47eb-9c54-5325fc98d954\">Mechanical trap</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f7fad6a4-4899-48f9-bed1-f78e277a8e2f\">When a creature steps on a hidden pressure plate, poison-tipped darts shoot from spring-loaded or pressurized tubes cleverly embedded in the surrounding walls. An area might include multiple pressure plates, each one rigged to its own set of darts.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"191de401-acd9-47b2-a592-daead256a1c2\">The tiny holes in the walls are obscured by dust and cobwebs, or cleverly hidden amid bas-reliefs, murals, or frescoes that adorn the walls. The DC to spot them is 15. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Investigation\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/8-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Investigation</a>) check, a character can deduce the presence of the pressure plate from variations in the mortar and stone used to create it, compared to the surrounding floor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. Stuffing the holes with cloth or wax prevents the darts contained within from launching.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"de2bde2b-a53b-4e40-b55a-e9ed31b964c1\">The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, releasing four darts. Each dart makes a ranged attack with a +8 bonus against a random target within 10 feet of the pressure plate (vision is irrelevant to this attack roll). (If there are no targets in the area, the darts don't hit anything.) A target that is hit takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\n<h5 id=\"PoisonNeedle\" data-content-chunk-id=\"a56d2019-eeda-4635-9d25-d97ae334e037\">Poison Needle</h5>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5fb0bdc1-1894-4d0b-abd3-319c16e3d344\">Mechanical trap</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d2414d59-ea43-47f3-83c0-2c93804c0d6b\">A poisoned needle is hidden within a treasure chest's lock, or in something else that a creature might open. Opening the chest without the proper key causes the needle to spring out, delivering a dose of poison.<br />When the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 inches straight out from the lock. A creature within range takes 1 piercing damage and 11 (2d10) poison damage, and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Poisoned\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/11-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">poisoned</a>&nbsp;for 1 hour.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3ab68e5d-39f8-404a-9587-e027f68ba989\">A successful DC 20 Intelligence (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Investigation\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/8-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Investigation</a>) check allows a character to deduce the trap's presence from alterations made to the lock to accommodate the needle. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools disarms the trap, removing the needle from the lock. Unsuccessfully attempting to pick the lock triggers the trap.</p>\n<h5 id=\"RollingSphere\" data-content-chunk-id=\"c9d8586b-949a-46a4-9495-0b4f71268080\">Rolling Sphere</h5>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"001882b5-8a9e-459c-a434-75a65dcf15f1\">Mechanical trap</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"fa731cfa-f5eb-4656-9ac2-3e0c44df4477\">When 20 or more pounds of pressure are placed on this trap's pressure plate, a hidden trapdoor in the ceiling opens, releasing a 10-foot-diameter rolling sphere of solid stone.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7b1e7689-3071-4cf2-b405-9717580d7ab1\">With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/14-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Perception</a>) check, a character can spot the trapdoor and pressure plate. A search of the floor accompanied by a successful DC 15 Intelligence (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Investigation\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/8-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Investigation</a>) check reveals variations in the mortar and stone that betray the pressure plate's presence. The same check made while inspecting the ceiling notes variations in the stonework that reveal the trapdoor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"02824079-9d0f-4518-92a3-288ad661c11f\">Activation of the sphere requires all creatures present to roll initiative. The sphere rolls initiative with a +8 bonus. On its turn, it moves 60 feet in a straight line. The sphere can move through creatures' spaces, and creatures can move through its space, treating it as difficult terrain. Whenever the sphere enters a creature's space or a creature enters its space while it's rolling, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/12-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">prone</a>.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a6c39cfb-e640-4f7e-938a-782c70373843\">The sphere stops when it hits a wall or similar barrier. It can't go around corners, but smart dungeon builders incorporate gentle, curving turns into nearby passages that allow the sphere to keep moving.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ca026d72-c681-4402-b087-972091482543\">As an action, a creature within 5 feet of the sphere can attempt to slow it down with a DC 20 Strength check. On a successful check, the sphere's speed is reduced by 15 feet. If the sphere's speed drops to 0, it stops moving and is no longer a threat.</p>\n<h5 id=\"SphereofAnnihilation\" data-content-chunk-id=\"e71ffdc3-0dfe-4d2f-a42c-74106353b73c\">Sphere of Annihilation</h5>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ba5df7a3-5796-43fa-b111-9c2e4bd931b4\">Magic trap</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ad3023ab-45c2-4f4a-80d4-ca18ce4e6f82\">Magical, impenetrable darkness fills the gaping mouth of a stone face carved into a wall. The mouth is 2 feet in diameter and roughly circular. No sound issues from it, no light can illuminate the inside of it, and any matter that enters it is instantly obliterated.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f80f3590-3c18-4778-832e-c0a5fdc72a65\">A successful DC 20 Intelligence (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Arcana\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/6-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Arcana</a>) check reveals that the mouth contains a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/sphere-of-annihilation\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4759-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">sphere of annihilation</a>&nbsp;that can't be controlled or moved.

An elf behind her, clad in studded leather armor, peppers the goblins with arrows loosed from his exquisite bow. The half-orc nearby shouts orders, helping the two combatants coordinate their assault to the best advantage.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4cf9553c-412c-4ffe-8abd-b9d6bf2e66fa\">A dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between the ogre&rsquo;s club and his companion, knocking the deadly blow aside. His companion, a half-elf in scale armor, swings two scimitars in a blinding whirl as she circles the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8cbeb04b-b5bb-43d6-ae79-6f50b261aaeb\">A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving them around for the crowd&rsquo;s delight &mdash; and his own tactical advantage. His opponent&rsquo;s sword flares with blue light an instant before she sends lightning flashing forth to smite him.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2df8492e-3188-48b6-8e8d-9eb98e5b637e\">All of these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most diverse class of characters in the worlds of&nbsp;Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit kings &mdash; as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.</p>\n<h3 id=\"WellRoundedSpecialists\" data-content-chunk-id=\"f34d7c4d-3d8d-4000-9b87-4930862848b9\">Well-Rounded Specialists</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"93e807e8-01f4-4f1e-8e6e-2a6c94340d2f\">Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.</p>\n<h3 id=\"TrainedforDanger\" data-content-chunk-id=\"4a75280a-e2a3-4465-911f-6001962d81ab\">Trained for Danger</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ac77ad26-53a6-4695-8713-74e5af9d57b8\">Not every member of the city watch, the village militia, or the queen&rsquo;s army is a fighter. Most of these troops are relatively untrained soldiers with only the most basic combat knowledge. Veteran soldiers, military officers, trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar figures are fighters.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5d952ab4-9674-4990-88cf-33c2d3e787be\">Some fighters feel drawn to use their training as adventurers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and other dangerous work common among adventurers is second nature for a fighter, not all that different from the life he or she left behind. There are greater risks, perhaps, but also much greater rewards &mdash; few fighters in the city watch have the opportunity to discover a magic&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/flame-tongue\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5386-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">flame tongue</a>&nbsp;sword, for example.</p>\n<h3 id=\"CreatingaFighter\" data-content-chunk-id=\"df238220-dada-45b0-868f-210f142b75e9\">Creating a Fighter</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e10a7235-2866-4058-b33e-330ff37bc745\"><a href=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/694/c3fighter1.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/694/300/269/c3fighter1.png\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5b011481-cfee-49f8-9f08-7f0975d2d047\">As you build your fighter, think about two related elements of your character&rsquo;s background: Where did you get your combat training, and what set you apart from the mundane warriors around you? Were you particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication? What drove you to this training in the first place? A threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove yourself might all have been factors.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6d7592ce-2a88-46b4-b35f-d78a802dffde\">You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble&rsquo;s army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history. Or you might be self-taught &mdash; unpolished but well tested. Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? They might have been military issue or family heirlooms, or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years to buy them. Your armaments are now among your most important possessions &mdash; the only things that stand between you and death&rsquo;s embrace.</p>\n<h4 id=\"QuickBuild\" data-content-chunk-id=\"9cf7ed3e-2918-4c03-a0fc-681433e92cc3\">Quick Build</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e9afe5c8-71a8-4bd8-aa06-935274246de0\">You can make a fighter quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on whether you want to focus on melee weapons or on archery (or finesse weapons). Your next-highest score should be Constitution, or Intelligence if you plan to adopt the Eldritch Knight martial archetype. Second, choose the soldier background.</p>\n<div>\n<table data-content-chunk-id=\"e1f70e5e-c4bb-40fe-8aef-aeccbe87cf05\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>\n<p>Level</p>\n</th>\n<th>\n<p>Proficiency<br

The Mounts and Other Animals table shows each animal&rsquo;s speed and base carrying capacity.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"248b44c7-7cc1-4ea8-8fc0-3b20bb19800d\">An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagon can move weight up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add their carrying capacity together.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c749efbc-e675-42c2-8d86-5a1fb6818b2f\">Mounts other than those listed here are available in fantasy gaming worlds, but they are rare and not normally available for purchase. These include flying mounts (pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs, and similar animals) and even aquatic mounts (giant sea horses, for example). Acquiring such a mount often means securing an egg and raising the creature yourself, making a bargain with a powerful entity, or negotiating with the mount itself.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"553c4d0c-9e29-4926-af14-0c158488b132\">Barding.&nbsp;Barding is armor designed to protect an animal&rsquo;s head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of armor shown on the Armor table can be purchased as barding. The cost is four times the equivalent armor made for humanoids, and it weighs twice as much.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4b61dc25-dcef-471a-9e51-fe88baddebc8\">Saddles.&nbsp;A military saddle braces the rider, helping you keep your seat on an active mount in battle. It gives you advantage on any check you make to remain mounted. An exotic saddle is required for riding any aquatic or flying mount.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5a451fe5-334e-4c26-a505-439a6b49e41c\">Vehicle Proficiency.&nbsp;If you have proficiency with a certain kind of vehicle (land or water), you can add your proficiency bonus to any check you make to control that kind of vehicle in difficult circumstances.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e44832b3-dc16-4c93-b8ed-5acab314bb2e\">Rowed Vessels.&nbsp;Keelboats and rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can&rsquo;t be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores. A rowboat weighs 100 pounds, in case adventurers carry it over land.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Mounts\" data-content-chunk-id=\"eac6ee69-463d-4245-8ba8-e236727675a3\">Mounts</h3>\n<div>\n<table

At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can't regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"aa88c24e-5390-42c4-9713-729234664e6f\">For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes.

Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"be6ad0aa-ce1f-4255-b31b-961a88f2bb3b\">A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a&nbsp;lightly obscured&nbsp;area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/14-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Perception</a>) checks that rely on sight.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ff08d7c7-375a-449c-bb1c-84881a11a38b\">A&nbsp;heavily obscured&nbsp;area--such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage--blocks vision entirely.

An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"91077c7f-6cb7-4b6e-ba95-a6fd2bded2c8\">Darkness&nbsp;creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Blindsight\" data-content-chunk-id=\"bed4927c-c8f6-4fb8-8e16-4d09a429283e\">Blindsight</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"03ec358c-02b8-4604-a107-a49653f02fd6\">A creature with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Blindsight\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/senses/1-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">blindsight</a>&nbsp;can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius.

The player tells the DM that his or her character is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the DM describes what, if anything, happens.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a11d4ab4-b5f1-455d-923e-421cfb1cb714\">For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the DM might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The DM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"32d8cdd8-29c2-401f-869b-12364d775c19\">Characters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"525f36f7-89c7-48ea-86c3-9f1fa523557b\">The DM determines an object's Armor Class and hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It's hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"840d2fdf-d0a5-4d47-a870-4491d77d69f2\">A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object.

You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.</p>\n<h4 id=\"LiftingandCarrying\" data-content-chunk-id=\"da900818-e651-4b28-aed7-7388837af0d9\">Lifting and Carrying</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1d2bb36b-b24c-48ea-acaa-015f9249201c\">Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"857d4121-ba2c-422d-896d-5db354d14242\">Carrying Capacity.&nbsp;Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15.

The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.</p>\n<h5 id=\"SleightofHand\" data-content-chunk-id=\"304c6b06-03b0-41b5-935a-04ad6c06f41f\">Sleight of Hand</h5>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e10393ae-99aa-43f9-8664-cd77ca09b122\">Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.

You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier.</p>\n<h4 id=\"ArmorClass\" data-content-chunk-id=\"04b4b52f-1cc0-4a46-b165-9f111fb99fc2\">Armor Class</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"db3bcbb0-adbb-43cf-9857-903c37afee0a\">Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Initiative\" data-content-chunk-id=\"bf1686dd-9a3b-44f0-9f56-27888957e14c\">Initiative</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"abdf6ed0-ac05-4272-b50a-7ce1c46f24e1\">At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check.

When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check's total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9c8a8481-93ea-4a02-8b8c-0cb9fa729988\">You can't hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase. An invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6b96730c-e319-45b3-8952-054cfe548a9a\">In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the DM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ae6e6e9c-deeb-46a2-8501-af714b7637ff\">Passive Perception.&nbsp;When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature's passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5c06e716-9f55-4b8f-90b8-abfeeda8357d\">What Can You See?&nbsp;One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be&nbsp;lightly&nbsp;or&nbsp;heavily obscured, as explained in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/adventuring\" data-content-chunk-id=\"a50c65eb-e88e-4f9d-9b45-028cb378e737\">chapter 8</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"Constitution\" data-content-chunk-id=\"ee1c7b8d-0867-48df-997c-83ba240c9e96\">Constitution</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7692fd1f-f2b2-4f87-88e3-13bc5405a7ad\">Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.</p>\n<h4 id=\"ConstitutionChecks\" data-content-chunk-id=\"8bb31e1d-e43f-47c3-aba4-46d456d1cbd2\">Constitution Checks</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d6c336e0-c01e-4c91-9bc4-eef871ce0a78\">Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"bfccdf6a-914f-46e9-b5b3-487766b62f79\">The DM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>\n<ul data-content-chunk-id=\"aa04412b-6e8d-45fc-aa46-e800934d9be3\">\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"78b7c8ac-28f1-401a-8ada-f92e864deecd\">Hold your breath</li>\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"48b4c5e3-9dc5-4637-8e0a-966c421ab3bc\">March or labor for hours without rest</li>\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"bad90389-9678-4cc6-9c6c-3ac6ad627d96\">Go without sleep</li>\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"d48e8b4b-0dc2-43cc-906c-119c6162f857\">Survive without food or water</li>\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"8685a121-f8be-4b2c-a46b-6961a6a7e1c5\">Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"HitPoints\" data-content-chunk-id=\"4e098158-dcf0-44e8-9000-ee241c0e2561\">Hit Points</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"71017e11-9e50-4071-be8a-67970948ac70\">Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points.

For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your new modifier. Or if you're 7th level and some effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is reduced by 7.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Intelligence\" data-content-chunk-id=\"6a0e9334-ef6a-4a48-b75e-b8056489cfb6\">Intelligence</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"cfac339c-d4cf-4bb0-8239-a4d922374911\">Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.</p>\n<h4 id=\"IntelligenceChecks\" data-content-chunk-id=\"e48740cd-aa43-4c02-99cf-0ed3c3e4c975\">Intelligence Checks</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"359c422b-beab-434b-b0a8-4b43d4951d6b\">An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning.

Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.</p>\n<h5 id=\"Nature\" data-content-chunk-id=\"7dd04394-a994-4667-a260-1563929a4e32\">Nature</h5>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5939857f-fe1d-4113-985e-a112d9268d71\">Your Intelligence (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.</p>\n<h5 id=\"Religion\" data-content-chunk-id=\"9e3e3c25-3d7d-426d-a5e7-69b967f64e68\">Religion</h5>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"feeab658-e56c-49f2-985d-0e7f4d70dc8d\">Your Intelligence (Religion) check measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.</p>\n<h5 id=\"OtherIntelligenceChecks\" data-content-chunk-id=\"f92a9520-06f2-44d4-ac90-e2bb51ab8fd5\">Other Intelligence Checks</h5>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c677c16a-794a-43ae-84fd-4de28d72e2b7\">The DM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>\n<ul data-content-chunk-id=\"d99c617b-cdc6-44da-bcd8-6a73ab810ffe\">\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"3adba21b-dedf-42d9-8139-883d01edbcfd\">Communicate with a creature without using words</li>\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"f139a635-846a-45ae-bdc9-43acb6b046b9\">Estimate the value of a precious item</li>\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"6e84bfaf-3104-4a31-ad86-8f0e3575e2ec\">Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard</li>\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"a06529b0-9f29-445d-b971-9d7c463ba52e\">Forge a document</li>\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"99dc055c-3934-4587-ae9a-2e0f70c03bed\">Recall lore about a craft or trade</li>\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"50234933-c3b5-4549-a597-c4a70f2e7a94\">Win a game of skill</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"SpellcastingAbility\" data-content-chunk-id=\"950922f4-6c5d-4214-a595-217bc649aa07\">Spellcasting Ability</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"be1bb542-1707-4acf-8114-88128f534de4\">Wizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Wisdom\" data-content-chunk-id=\"cab64d53-c5e3-4eca-9565-a7d15b3ab840\">Wisdom</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9c598d7d-1c39-48af-979e-ed5f5e2ad627\">Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.</p>\n<h4 id=\"WisdomChecks\" data-content-chunk-id=\"97b91010-d9f2-44d7-92db-9a4f5439ad8b\">Wisdom Checks</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"076909df-446c-4e3f-a8c7-eb2a0bb13859\">A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone&rsquo;s feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.</p>\n<h5 id=\"AnimalHandling\" data-content-chunk-id=\"67e49ee0-ffdf-44a0-8261-c5cfaaf20690\">Animal Handling</h5>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a9772ece-c8ed-40da-8a3d-06b86434605f\">When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal&rsquo;s intentions, the DM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.</p>\n<h5 id=\"Insight\" data-content-chunk-id=\"361ed3db-1e56-41fa-bfcf-330d1023cea5\">Insight</h5>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f19aabed-8094-4e6a-bc77-d44cd5d6a1ae\">Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone&rsquo;s next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.</p>\n<h5 id=\"Medicine\" data-content-chunk-id=\"f97e79ea-d4a7-43c0-bf67-eab05e6fa86f\">Medicine</h5>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"37284abb-cc3b-45b9-ba05-4ba8e98eebf5\">A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.</p>\n<h5 id=\"Perception\" data-content-chunk-id=\"9c72b909-f57f-4841-a4ed-02b2ea6590d7\">Perception</h5>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"799a45cc-7306-469e-b2a9-e6b835a51968\">Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.</p>\n<aside>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"finding-a-hidden-object\">FINDING A HIDDEN OBJECT</p>\n<p>When your character searches for a hidden object such as a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check. Such a check can be used to find hidden details or other information and clues that you might otherwise overlook.</p>\n<p>In most cases, you need to describe where you are looking in order for the DM to determine your chance of success. For example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes in the top drawer of a bureau. If you tell the DM that you pace around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for clues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of your Wisdom (Perception) check result. You would have to specify that you were opening the drawers or searching the bureau in order to have any chance of success.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<h5 id=\"Survival\" data-content-chunk-id=\"54b20ee7-0538-4563-ba60-58e4e44543f2\">Survival</h5>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3c8d794b-7e8b-4494-9f14-a57698b740c5\">The DM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.</p>\n<h5 id=\"OtherWisdomChecks\" data-content-chunk-id=\"03522191-7257-4623-bda2-ac5598818530\">Other Wisdom Checks</h5>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a03b7d62-0557-4d53-a873-3f378d40c839\">The DM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>\n<ul data-content-chunk-id=\"dcc58d28-1fc0-4d4b-a009-2340602765e2\">\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"9b95224a-325e-49eb-87fb-7f3a86b074dc\">Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow</li>\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"5b3cf36d-404c-4b04-b6db-898fb48fbee4\">Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"SpellcastingAbility\" data-content-chunk-id=\"827ced92-e7d5-4e41-bbc6-ff395d39133e\">Spellcasting Ability</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"39958e0a-416d-467e-ae67-08e94e1d41c4\">Clerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Charisma\" data-content-chunk-id=\"c1bb040d-4109-4180-8546-dbaaccef5236\">Charisma</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"566242c5-f01f-40ba-9ffe-6d27fc5687e1\">Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.</p>\n<h4 id=\"CharismaChecks\" data-content-chunk-id=\"8158c907-fcb9-44da-9a3a-640941062f31\">Charisma Checks</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b370a94c-7e21-4b66-bf90-c2b58072d642\">A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.</p>\n<h5 id=\"Deception\" data-content-chunk-id=\"ae60024c-9693-4aad-af86-8e038bdc3e7b\">Deception</h5>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ec8141e1-68a5-485c-9314-1e7915364ad6\">Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone's suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.</p>\n<h5 id=\"Intimidation\" data-content-chunk-id=\"bb84665b-7f7f-4db8-aab3-c5840522b92f\">Intimidation</h5>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2dd9d383-c5ac-4e32-82ea-49fcfda7a1a2\">When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.</p>\n<h5 id=\"Performance\" data-content-chunk-id=\"de0f3053-d9c5-473a-a25c-c58463b8e97c\">Performance</h5>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b7c30d44-7dc3-4305-967b-9258670d52d0\">Your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.</p>\n<h5 id=\"Persuasion\" data-content-chunk-id=\"f236d7bd-2a3a-4f33-8710-79a54f043bb1\">Persuasion</h5>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a5fe30bd-9468-4439-bd6b-49202a3d5acd\">When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.</p>\n<h5 id=\"OtherCharismaChecks\" data-content-chunk-id=\"79119edc-9b73-47ef-b30a-38011f1b4e2c\">Other Charisma Checks</h5>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"930e0a0a-bbe1-47af-aef6-4cb7ba6ad9f7\">The DM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p>\n<ul data-content-chunk-id=\"221240b8-dcee-4266-8bd7-53308d5e0b2e\">\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"9f718723-21ee-4bec-b2da-5f29ef470dcd\">Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip</li>\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"231254b8-9f02-42d6-9960-a4394590fb6f\">Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"SpellcastingAbility\" data-content-chunk-id=\"4b98dd69-045b-4c25-9c4b-60ccfaa6f3fc\">Spellcasting Ability</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"28c2aea0-0165-4613-be0b-3d19e324b914\">Bards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.</p>","_id":"VuytgP4V05zL6CiD"}

If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can&rsquo;t be held or carried by an unwilling creature.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"dac91020-83e6-4ba4-987e-7a3996462a40\">The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you.

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy&rsquo;s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a6d90e5e-7011-4c0a-8fca-bd84b68334a1\">On Target.&nbsp;You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"566e8e3e-18fc-484d-8068-a5dba81bb0d3\">Off Target.&nbsp;You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 &times; 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b6e3fb39-a0d7-4382-832c-14bb7abd4648\">Similar Area.&nbsp;You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that&rsquo;s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard&rsquo;s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a929a553-baf9-41f7-8ca9-7ae6891a3fdc\">Mishap.&nbsp;The spell&rsquo;s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>\n<h3 id=\"TeleportationCircle\" data-content-chunk-id=\"b86956d6-0364-4228-b415-5cb315e2e379\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/teleportation-circle\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2276-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Teleportation Circle</a></h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4a8acbbe-e7dd-4ff7-a82d-3da10c601d55\">5th-level conjuration</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"17b338a6-f6fa-48b1-90ff-fbc7fb3a906c\">Casting Time:&nbsp;1 minute</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c31c9eab-76ae-4e3b-9d6e-d6feb1999e0d\">Range:&nbsp;10 feet</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a0424e21-17f9-4888-ae42-05aee8cee717\">Components:&nbsp;V, M (rare chalks and inks infused with precious gems worth 50 gp, which the spell consumes)</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"99c8b6de-766e-4591-955f-377b8487a277\">Duration:&nbsp;1 round</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"fdcba66b-3aaf-47a5-8d79-68360f0414c8\">As you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7ead25af-ee20-4d0c-94d0-7b3750c2b0a3\">Many major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence&mdash;a string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the DM. You can learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"828e9f3d-ee75-4362-87dd-495accee18df\">You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same location every day for one year. You need not use the circle to teleport when you cast the spell in this way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Thaumaturgy\" data-content-chunk-id=\"51bd45b1-fe94-476c-9e29-4c50cf7a0e3a\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/thaumaturgy\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2277-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Thaumaturgy</a></h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4e8154ed-9ff3-4de6-b20a-fc666e337184\">Transmutation cantrip</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"010bcba0-574e-44c7-8ce2-833e4541bd82\">Casting Time:&nbsp;1 action</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"cf6d493e-fd2d-4ca5-9da2-36f68d43b34b\">Range:&nbsp;30 feet</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7f191cc9-cfa5-435b-826a-482fcc398033\">Components:&nbsp;V</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"199f1e8e-1a4f-429b-bd2d-b18b782a3e98\">Duration:&nbsp;Up to 1 minute</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c2090a53-f7c5-410e-8b54-8db7f638a7da\">You manifest a minor wonder, a sign of supernatural power, within range.

Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b0dd7960-6f01-4d9e-ab90-9f1a858830b5\">A creature's current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature's hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6e6587a9-bfd7-4fc5-9451-e1205970f95c\">Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature's capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.</p>\n<h3 id=\"DamageRolls\" data-content-chunk-id=\"c505f4a9-5731-4568-b7c3-ca9adac8b190\">Damage Rolls</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"965165e1-d285-4c4d-b18d-e0132ef8c226\"><a href=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/4/981/202.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/4/981/280/369/202.png\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"81aa1c56-ec56-4b76-91d6-a3be91a49303\">Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"791b7795-820f-44d3-9cdc-a0d56e86db3e\">With a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ff903eee-c687-48d8-b35b-a58089f34898\">When attacking with a&nbsp;weapon, you add your ability modifier--the same modifier used for the attack roll--to the damage. A&nbsp;spell&nbsp;tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d85f3f65-01d6-46cd-a78c-0dbb8b483afb\">If a spell or other effect deals damage to&nbsp;more than one target&nbsp;at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them. For example, when a wizard casts&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fireball\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2102-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">fireball</a>&nbsp;or a cleric casts&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/flame-strike\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2107-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">flame strike</a>, the spell's damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast.</p>\n<h4 id=\"CriticalHits\" data-content-chunk-id=\"06a70df9-0500-4710-b639-55371a0f133b\">Critical Hits</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"49a5da98-419f-43b6-8006-5ff4f1a04099\">When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack's damage against the target. Roll all of the attack's damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"508dcffd-2f2d-4a14-92a2-a195a78fbad6\">For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue's Sneak Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well.</p>\n<h3 id=\"DamageTypes\" data-content-chunk-id=\"113119f2-0096-44cd-92bf-cf0a53554047\">Damage Types</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d7ca55b0-9779-429d-9b5d-a2e729dd5b7d\">Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage.

If a creature or an object has&nbsp;vulnerability&nbsp;to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"431473c0-57d6-49ba-8aca-f944528c6e74\">Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"13ea5f40-57f8-4f62-bb81-7d3400bad3f6\">Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Healing\" data-content-chunk-id=\"a48b5786-9afc-41a5-9d1c-eff51a4e218c\">Healing</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d44c73ab-ef9f-4c0c-a102-6c2b9864b5ef\">Unless it results in death, damage isn't permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic.

A creature's hit points can't exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a98f8510-17ab-4695-bf1b-725f392ef122\">A creature that has died can't regain hit points until magic such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/revivify\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2234-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">revivify</a>&nbsp;spell has restored it to life.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Droppingto0HitPoints\" data-content-chunk-id=\"0b6fc11b-05b4-4bea-b3d4-237ca73361d4\">Dropping to 0 Hit Points</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4d3430a1-4677-4a9d-913d-9a0c4d3c4e94\">When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Unconscious\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/15-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">unconscious</a>, as explained in the following sections.</p>\n<h4 id=\"InstantDeath\" data-content-chunk-id=\"591b66f2-fa55-4098-84d6-8b2d8c8e0ecd\">Instant Death</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"33cd2675-d625-4cfa-b80d-8468fb966ae0\">Massive damage can kill you instantly.

Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.</p>\n<h4 id=\"FallingUnconscious\" data-content-chunk-id=\"508d749d-560c-483a-a08b-646a5168b2a0\">Falling Unconscious</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5b3fd956-f931-493c-a92f-958fde4c1570\">If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Unconscious\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/15-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">unconscious</a>.

Unlike other saving throws, this one isn't tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"52386fe7-c80d-47d1-821e-56a493ce6232\">Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"63a87604-77d7-4b5f-9b22-f49d62aac2dc\">Rolling 1 or 20.&nbsp;When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures.

Temporary hit points aren't actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8a508566-426f-461f-85f2-60a54f2f6daa\">When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"426946c2-0887-4d91-8a53-206a2ac32161\">Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4eddd101-e683-4a21-b557-cef35e7c6c48\">Healing can't restore temporary hit points, and they can't be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4bdab06c-5090-44bd-a4ed-5b86182da924\">If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn't restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed at you while you're in that state, but only true healing can save you.<br />Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they're depleted or you finish a long rest.</p>","_id":"YAGf5kTDku7B8ADU"}

The DM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3adcf71a-53a2-4854-9f4b-345634df25de\">For every ability check, the DM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"TypicalDifficultyClasses\" data-content-chunk-id=\"631c4ff0-fc2b-4933-bbc8-e1a4ea98a3a5\">Typical Difficulty Classes</h3>\n<div>\n<table data-content-chunk-id=\"a816778f-9707-46a9-a153-e370c9dac79f\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Task Difficulty</th>\n<th>DC</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Very easy</td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Easy</td>\n<td>10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hard</td>\n<td>20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Very hard</td>\n<td>25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Nearly impossible</td>\n<td>30</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"fe73a11b-bbf7-4d4a-9cb2-803dfe595fb3\">To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success--the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it's a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the DM.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Contests\" data-content-chunk-id=\"9e75532a-396d-41ef-8e5f-7eb2d24777ab\">Contests</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"890d80b1-e382-4756-a1ed-52213e402124\">Sometimes one character's or monster's efforts are directly opposed to another's. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"71167790-1707-4b18-9a92-a6c54e0883e9\">This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal--for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"034162b5-467d-48c6-930c-13f9512bac07\">Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"79c85a90-a69c-466a-bec7-1fb67ddfc22e\">If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Skills\" data-content-chunk-id=\"1501469c-9c7a-46ef-8716-7457933913ee\">Skills</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"07182de4-31ec-4dbe-9066-faeb4651c8d6\">Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual's proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character's starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster's skill proficiencies appear in the monster's stat block.)</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b9a80ac3-616d-4f2c-b7fa-261f7aed45e0\">For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character's attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9303f275-4944-4244-aab4-b7e2d6eb40f6\">The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list.

In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"cb437040-294f-4543-94a4-8c915d02b1fe\">For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the DM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character's proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.</p>\n<h4 id=\"VariantSkillswithDifferentAbilities\" data-content-chunk-id=\"b6a8fc7a-1e1f-47c7-8913-21addcb68636\">Variant: Skills with Different Abilities</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4c94836f-27a3-4925-96ac-7eae4c47aca3\">Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the DM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your DM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your DM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your DM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you're proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your half-&shy;‐‑orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your DM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma.</p>\n<h3 id=\"PassiveChecks\" data-content-chunk-id=\"b7d885da-fb92-4373-94fd-bc530fe4413b\">Passive Checks</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"cf757d63-6c6d-4599-b56e-82af41be025b\">A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn't involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the DM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f435eea1-d4a2-4406-afc9-7044bd82b6f6\">Here's how to determine a character's total for a passive check:</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3d75650c-1b0f-484b-b009-86c3ebe6f2bc\">10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"23dd7e53-3e3a-438c-b353-29e7dbd55832\">If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a&nbsp;score.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"00821a68-4df2-4fb4-91ae-016b4ecb5306\">For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.<br />The rules on hiding in the &ldquo;Dexterity&rdquo; section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules.</p>\n<h3 id=\"WorkingTogether\" data-content-chunk-id=\"4ca4c3a3-0ce5-4d15-a20f-8d606005d51b\">Working Together</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"897dcf9e-6d5a-4611-88d4-c5ab6251ab0a\">Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who's leading the effort--or the one with the highest ability modifier--can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5c643943-b678-40ac-89ae-511969cd9e2d\">A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves' tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can't help another character in that task.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ae9d1cea-72e7-4601-802c-d51619fca8f9\">Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.</p>\n<h4 id=\"GroupChecks\" data-content-chunk-id=\"422e007b-4a8d-471d-bbfc-1841f1a28c53\">Group Checks</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a648f46f-efa5-4903-ad7f-effbc7fac503\">When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the DM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren't.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"571be4ed-62bb-4004-abbf-06190065fa18\">To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"670db527-3813-49d1-9678-51b37bb8c9e9\">Otherwise, the group fails. Group checks don't come up very often, and they're most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the DM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.</p>","_id":"Ye4gO2vrbwC2ulOY"}

You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3c88658c-f919-4266-84b9-0c2477d45369\">The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Investigation\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/8-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Investigation</a>) check against your spell save DC to be found.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1a0a67c6-6218-4905-92e7-91634c22b7fe\">You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"29df1a89-2f39-40be-aa98-3b8b2f240e9f\">You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don&rsquo;t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"58825e9f-991e-4a52-a76f-8a0a030d6589\">When you inscribe the glyph, choose&nbsp;explosive runes&nbsp;or a&nbsp;spell glyph.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8976fb79-bce3-4c00-aabf-00b6d596e152\">Explosive Runes.&nbsp;When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e44a9250-38a2-4d56-8ef9-d435f73c3cc8\">Spell Glyph.&nbsp;You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"50166dc6-6828-4646-9986-8af028c4a166\">At Higher Levels.&nbsp;When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an&nbsp;explosive runes&nbsp;glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.

He usually rose before most of his warriors, since he had a strong streak of human blood in him, and he found the daylight less bothersome than most of his tribe did. Among the Bloody Skulls, a warrior was judged by his strength, his fierceness, and his wits. Human ancestry was no blemish against a warrior &mdash; provided he was every bit as strong, enduring, and bloodthirsty as his full-blooded kin. Half-orcs who were weaker than their orc comrades didn&rsquo;t last long among the Bloody Skulls or any other orc tribe for that matter. But it was often true that a bit of human blood gave a warrior just the right mix of cunning, ambition, and self-discipline to go far indeed, as Mhurren had. He was master of a tribe that could muster two thousand spears, and the strongest chief in Thar.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"bcd864c8-b262-4341-b24e-9937153bf427\">&mdash;&nbsp;Richard Baker,&nbsp;Swordmage</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ff66179b-feb1-440f-8f48-db5594154487\">Whether united under the leadership of a mighty warlock or having fought to a standstill after years of conflict, orc and human tribes sometimes form alliances, joining forces into a larger horde to the terror of civilized lands nearby. When these alliances are sealed by marriages, half-orcs are born. Some half-orcs rise to become proud chiefs of orc tribes, their human blood giving them an edge over their full-blooded orc rivals. Some venture into the world to prove their worth among humans and other more civilized races. Many of these become adventurers, achieving greatness for their mighty deeds and notoriety for their barbaric customs and&nbsp;savage fury.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ScarredandStrong\" data-content-chunk-id=\"8860d487-97f0-43c5-91c7-71f45613900e\">Scarred and Strong</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8b88fe49-d598-4783-8acb-d1cbd0543489\">Half-orcs&rsquo; grayish pigmentation, sloping foreheads, jutting jaws, prominent teeth, and towering builds make their orcish heritage plain for all to see. Half-orcs stand between 5 and 7 feet tall and usually weigh between 180 and 250 pounds.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"beedba67-c054-44fd-8999-fb8188915e1c\">Orcs regard battle scars as tokens of pride and ornamental scars as things of beauty. Other scars, though, mark an orc or half-orc as a former slave or a disgraced exile. Any half-orc who has lived among or near orcs has scars, whether they are marks of humiliation or of pride, recounting their past exploits and injuries. Such a half-orc living among humans might display these scars proudly or hide them in shame.</p>\n<h3 id=\"TheMarkofGruumsh\" data-content-chunk-id=\"b7f47538-bdd6-4206-b5b3-46dccf8a2b44\">The Mark of Gruumsh</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ab86cdd0-d3e8-447c-96de-d9580fc70fa5\"><a href=\"http://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/644/half-orc1.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\" data-content-chunk-id=\"9cc9759b-d921-4141-98f0-f3545340f5e2\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/644/300/300/half-orc1.png\" alt=\"\" data-content-chunk-id=\"3b78ef68-b31e-49d3-8451-d948d0102b7e\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0a572944-3694-4e8f-aef6-4e20a4ba24a3\">The one-eyed god Gruumsh created the orcs, and even those orcs who turn away from his worship can&rsquo;t fully escape his influence. The same is true of half-orcs, though their human blood moderates the impact of their orcish heritage. Some half-orcs hear the whispers of Gruumsh in their dreams, calling them to unleash the rage that simmers within them. Others feel Gruumsh&rsquo;s exultation when they join in melee combat &mdash; and either exult along with him or shiver with fear and loathing. Half-orcs are not evil by nature, but evil does lurk within them, whether they embrace it or rebel against it.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"58ac5e21-e93b-482c-b798-54fa60528e68\">Beyond the rage of Gruumsh, half-orcs feel emotion powerfully. Rage doesn&rsquo;t just quicken their pulse, it makes their bodies burn. An insult stings like acid, and sadness saps their strength. But they laugh loudly and heartily, and simple bodily pleasures &mdash; feasting, drinking, wrestling, drumming, and wild dancing &mdash; fill their hearts with joy. They tend to be short-tempered and sometimes sullen, more inclined to action than contemplation and to fighting than arguing. The most accomplished half-orcs are those with enough self-control to get by in a civilized land.</p>\n<h3 id=\"TribesandSlums\" data-content-chunk-id=\"b4a00c3a-3dec-4ee9-bdc7-b6f294636735\">Tribes and Slums</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"12d37fde-e359-4820-9c3d-29035f6cc157\">Half-orcs most often live among orcs. Of the other races, humans are most likely to accept half-orcs, and half-orcs almost always live in human lands when not living among orc tribes. Whether proving themselves among rough barbarian tribes or scrabbling to survive in the slums of larger cities, half-orcs get by on their physical might, their endurance, and the sheer determination they inherit from their human ancestry.</p>\n<blockquote data-content-chunk-id=\"c2d9da66-7867-4659-b44a-a76665823168\">\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"574931f5-40ab-480e-a22c-3762b740a20f\">GRUDGING ACCEPTANCE</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8fe80786-d9b1-4a04-bd48-067b0d84d206\">Each half-orc finds a way to gain acceptance from those who hate orcs. Some are reserved, trying not to draw attention to themselves. A few demonstrate piety and good-heartedness as publicly as they can (whether or not such demonstrations are genuine). And some simply try to be so tough that others just avoid them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"HalfOrcNames\" data-content-chunk-id=\"2172de76-f10d-4ab0-8c64-758e215e0727\">Half-Orc Names</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"dc8ddc62-9296-4748-8f59-21334059c4bf\">Half-orcs usually have names appropriate to the culture in which they were raised. A half-orc who wants to fit in among humans might trade an orc name for a human name. Some half-orcs with human names decide to adopt a guttural orc name because they think it makes them more&nbsp;intimidating.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"84f472fd-7733-43ce-bb59-ffdfc4d9bc37\">Male Orc Names:&nbsp;Dench, Feng, Gell, Henk, Holg, Imsh, Keth, Krusk, Mhurren, Ront,&nbsp;Shump, Thokk</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"75f0d5f8-187c-4465-bced-b01fac9fe61d\">Female Orc Names:&nbsp;Baggi, Emen, Engong, Kansif, Myev, Neega, Ovak, Ownka, Shautha, Sutha, Vola, Volen, Yevelda</p>\n<h3 id=\"HalfOrcTraits\" data-content-chunk-id=\"4b55213b-f957-4a26-96a5-653662f00194\">Half-Orc Traits</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3bd4df59-7bc4-4ee8-9ff1-14fc6e2dd73b\">Your half-orc character has certain traits deriving from your&nbsp;orc ancestry.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7ef4f415-014e-454b-b51b-25f3e2e9b1ad\">Ability Score Increase.&nbsp;Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"32ff6911-8742-4f3a-97e1-1c2d278a7f12\">Age.&nbsp;Half-orcs mature a little faster than humans, reaching adulthood around age 14.

Half-orcs raised among orcs and willing to live out their lives among them are&nbsp;usually evil.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"57ad4908-141e-48cd-834e-db71d550b678\">Size.&nbsp;Half-orcs are somewhat larger and bulkier than humans, and they range from 5 to well over 6 feet tall.

They claim no mastery over nature. Instead, they see themselves as extensions of nature&rsquo;s indomitable will.</p>\n<h3 id=\"PowerofNature\" data-content-chunk-id=\"10ed6e97-0e57-4ae2-84c2-21a0209b7b77\">Power of Nature</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"57b204d2-f9bd-4036-96cc-dc9fab32e2d2\">Druids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and other magical powers either from the force of nature itself or from a nature deity. Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of transcendent union with nature rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others serve gods of wild nature, animals, or elemental forces. The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes called the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship of gods in temples and shrines.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f79bf370-a361-437d-8ca0-c215da4a7f6d\">Druid spells are oriented toward nature and animals &mdash; the power of tooth and claw, of sun and moon, of fire and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal forms, and some druids make a particular study of this practice, even to the point where they prefer animal form to their natural form.</p>\n<h3 id=\"PreservetheBalance\" data-content-chunk-id=\"e873f781-7748-43bc-a391-be6c4095d0cf\">Preserve the Balance</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2904f876-368b-40ae-aeee-17d0265c8ab0\"><a href=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/692/c3druid1.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/692/300/300/c3druid1.png\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"010a6652-49fa-43d9-8dce-a743ba56f361\">For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The four elements that make up a world &mdash; air, earth, fire, and water &mdash; must remain in equilibrium. If one element were to gain power over the others, the world could be destroyed, drawn into one of the elemental planes and broken apart into its component elements. Thus, druids oppose cults of Elemental Evil and others who promote one element to the exclusion of others.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2571a8f0-c1c0-4a7a-b843-65b202c9c91a\">Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need for civilized folk to live in harmony with nature, not in opposition to it. Druids accept that which is cruel in nature, and they hate that which is unnatural, including aberrations (such as beholders and mind flayers) and undead (such as zombies and vampires). Druids sometimes lead raids against such creatures, especially when the monsters encroach on the druids&rsquo; territory.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"bf35e084-0238-4e00-8a02-740756797178\">Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a significant danger arises, threatening nature&rsquo;s balance or the lands they protect, druids take on a more active role in combating the threat, as adventurers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"CreatingaDruid\" data-content-chunk-id=\"af24ff51-b323-49a7-91bb-bd06432fe24e\">Creating a Druid</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ca7e5808-d17f-4307-a0e7-8de66c80068b\">When making a druid, consider why your character has such a close bond with nature. Perhaps your character lives in a society where the Old Faith still thrives, or was raised by a druid after being abandoned in the depths of a forest. Perhaps your character had a dramatic encounter with the spirits of nature, coming face to face with a giant eagle or dire wolf and surviving the experience. Maybe your character was born during an epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which was interpreted as a sign that becoming a druid was part of your character&rsquo;s destiny.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"22121275-4afb-44a8-aac7-5a67670afa4e\">Have you always been an adventurer as part of your druidic calling, or did you first spend time as a caretaker of a sacred grove or spring?

You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"674198f5-255a-46b1-98c4-2eed32f9922b\">Spell save DC&nbsp;= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d2232c52-9c6b-47a5-a04a-ddfa1d0af961\">Spell attack modifier&nbsp;= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<h4 id=\"RitualCasting\" data-content-chunk-id=\"1c1d8ef5-d126-4dc0-910d-1f52534d9ba2\">Ritual Casting</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ce532e94-074c-4b49-b1e6-b78315595ef2\">You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\n<h4 id=\"SpellcastingFocus\" data-content-chunk-id=\"d8705f66-a73f-49b8-8437-6740d5945c4c\">Spellcasting Focus</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"76caa252-991c-487a-834a-15815f605889\">You can use a druidic focus (see chapter 5, &ldquo;<a title=\"Druidic Focus\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#DruidicFocus\" data-content-chunk-id=\"947132b4-8f73-4ec7-b4ac-ed31c92216d1\">Equip&shy;ment</a>&rdquo;) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</p>\n<blockquote data-content-chunk-id=\"27511fd4-9f36-49fb-a9f7-4d5f568ae9df\">\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"50801dbd-c884-49aa-898b-ac677146c12b\">SACRED PLANTS AND WOOD</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"43d56ff5-c97d-4709-a8c0-59a37504d99f\">A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f16fd8cf-06db-4ddc-8a7a-17923eab8eef\">Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4b61ac03-fb32-4450-8d96-5fe7ff5277ed\">Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"WildShape\" data-content-chunk-id=\"c56e7f73-7e1c-423b-bc57-06a5fa541969\">Wild Shape</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"87f18d1c-9710-466d-98c8-31526c4ccace\">Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b18216fd-ceee-407f-bec6-7ade410fd5e9\">Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table.

You automatically revert if you fall&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Unconscious\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/15-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">unconscious</a>, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e52a07dc-d24b-435b-8455-036cc775ca13\">While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\n<ul data-content-chunk-id=\"41e43ad1-212a-4bfe-9659-7ea547547976\">\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"edf0c1ca-1423-40b5-81f7-0d3d883aebe0\">Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature&rsquo;s bonus instead of yours.

When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage.

Transforming doesn&rsquo;t break your concentration on a spell you&rsquo;ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/call-lightning\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2022-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">call lightning</a>, that you&rsquo;ve already cast.</li>\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"ee24ea45-bc2b-40d3-9aa9-92c9d9e77724\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can&rsquo;t use any of your special senses, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Darkvision\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/senses/2-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">darkvision</a>, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"d94dac86-6bb8-4f87-bf2a-225b87f8703f\">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature&rsquo;s shape and size. Your equipment doesn&rsquo;t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can&rsquo;t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"DruidCircle\" data-content-chunk-id=\"6a236321-82e5-4bf6-b2b5-1bc9bb2b89e8\">Druid Circle</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0a3671f2-d436-486e-99a3-40b627d515f0\">At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land or the Circle of the Moon, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"DruidAbilityScoreImprovement\" data-content-chunk-id=\"b7a85abc-68ef-40f5-bd9b-48d4dccdd145\">Ability Score Improvement</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"66259127-41bb-45ef-a819-f79f5974337b\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can&rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<h3 id=\"TimelessBody\" data-content-chunk-id=\"1ee78c17-904e-47ed-ab08-b1b249e994ed\">Timeless Body</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2352c83e-87d2-4dcb-85a0-f3eb8a29d97d\">Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly.

You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren&rsquo;t able to provide material components.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Archdruid\" data-content-chunk-id=\"1b7b4038-b679-4be4-a0b9-eba66131a9e0\">Archdruid</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4e534b0b-1fc8-435c-9dc7-1e6633d73dca\">At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e8a101b6-9b5d-46f6-9c88-b268781a9886\">Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren&rsquo;t consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.</p>\n<h2 id=\"DruidCircles\" data-content-chunk-id=\"8024dc6a-5166-4f4a-8920-360eebfa064f\">Druid Circles</h2>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9f4c5f4f-6d39-49d5-90a1-2af6d9363e74\"><a href=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/689/c3druid2.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/689/400/370/c3druid2.png\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d83e6757-6302-4804-82bc-3dc2a1cc5bfe\">Though their organization is invisible to most outsiders, druids are part of a society that spans the land, ignoring political borders. All druids are nominally members of this druidic society, though some individuals are so isolated that they have never seen any high-ranking members of the society or participated in druidic gatherings. Druids recognize each other as brothers and sisters. Like creatures of the wilderness, however, druids sometimes compete with or even prey on each other.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d58ceabb-870c-433d-859a-a33b6df55dc9\">At a local scale, druids are organized into circles that share certain perspectives on nature, balance, and the way of the druid.</p>\n<h3 id=\"CircleoftheLand\" data-content-chunk-id=\"a4b4deb9-e7b2-4086-a04d-f534f5ddf68b\">Circle of the Land</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f9f92943-fa50-40de-96c2-99574c8f2de9\">The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle&rsquo;s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle&rsquo;s mysterious rites.</p>\n<h4 id=\"BonusCantrip\" data-content-chunk-id=\"cd2e838e-70bf-44e1-8db5-7fdf35f55ddb\">Bonus Cantrip</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9383df86-83ec-4a15-b81d-76c8bfcf2a27\">When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice.</p>\n<h4 id=\"NaturalRecovery\" data-content-chunk-id=\"9f338bfc-d998-4efb-84c9-59d3017b2061\">Natural Recovery</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c7c7bb2e-0bea-4df4-81c3-9511cc672016\">Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can&rsquo;t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a5c35e78-47c4-439f-a20e-307fd7a9e0eb\">For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.</p>\n<h4 id=\"CircleSpells\" data-content-chunk-id=\"251ba46e-5550-4bdc-834f-0c23931144c1\">Circle Spells</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4b9a144d-22b1-4547-8df7-50223e4197ca\">Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land &mdash; arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or Underdark &mdash; and consult the associated list of spells.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9f94d022-c625-456c-8ae7-c2822d2aafd7\">Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn&rsquo;t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn&rsquo;t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</p>\n<h5 id=\"Arctic\"

The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples. In fact, in the world of Greyhawk, the druidic faith is called the Old Faith, and it claims many adherents among farmers, foresters, fishers, and others who live closely with nature. This tradition includes the worship of Nature as a primal force beyond personification, but also encompasses the worship of Beory, the Oerth Mother, as well as devotees of Obad-Hai, Ehlonna, and Ulaa.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"18697446-a998-4b27-88d8-d98ce389dec9\">In the worlds of Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms, druidic circles are not usually connected to the faith of a single nature deity. Any given circle in the Forgotten Realms, for example, might include druids who revere Silvanus, Mielikki, Eldath, Chauntea, or even the harsh Gods of Fury: Talos, Malar, Auril, and Umberlee. These nature gods are often called the First Circle, the first among the druids, and most druids count them all (even the violent ones) as worthy of veneration.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c5f6ffbe-03eb-4822-9af0-2d40897c4f2d\">The druids of Eberron hold animistic beliefs completely unconnected to the Sovereign Host, the Dark Six, or any of the other religions of the world. They believe that every living thing and every natural phenomenon &mdash; sun, moon, wind, fire, and the world itself &mdash; has a spirit. Their spells, then, are a means to communicate with and command these spirits. Different druidic sects, though, hold different philosophies about the proper relationship of these spirits to each other and to the forces of civilization. The Ashbound, for example, believe that arcane magic is an abomination against nature, the Children of Winter venerate the forces of death, and the Gatekeepers preserve ancient traditions meant to protect the world from the incursion of aberrations.</p>\n</blockquote>","_id":"bH3KOaq90NCmeAeC"}

It encompasses every world where DMs run their adventures, all within the relatively mundane realm of the Material Plane. Beyond that plane are domains of raw elemental matter and energy, realms of pure thought and ethos, the homes of demons and angels, and the dominions of the gods.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7b0c68d7-97f9-4131-b161-093eee4a736e\">Many spells and magic items can draw energy from these planes, summon the creatures that dwell there, communicate with their denizens, and allow adventurers to travel there. As your character achieves greater power and higher levels, you might walk on streets made of solid fire or test your mettle on a battlefield where the fallen are resurrected with each dawn.</p>\n<h2 id=\"TheMaterialPlane\" data-content-chunk-id=\"6605e315-de35-4fac-b994-d17d32ff45a5\">The Material Plane</h2>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6a1abda5-ba60-4f69-89c0-364a9b581275\">The Material Plane is the nexus where the philosophical and elemental forces that define the other planes collide in the jumbled existence of mortal life and mundane matter. All fantasy gaming worlds exist within the Material Plane, making it the starting point for most campaigns and adventures. The rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to the Material Plane.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7a25045e-853d-44b8-b737-66b88ee616aa\">The worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse, for they reflect the creative imagination of the DMs who set their games there, as well as the players whose heroes adventure there. They include magic-wasted desert planets and island-dotted water worlds, worlds where magic combines with advanced technology and others trapped in an endless Stone Age, worlds where the gods walk and places they have abandoned.</p>\n<h2 id=\"BeyondtheMaterial\" data-content-chunk-id=\"d5cf1e7e-ef7f-4a89-a6a0-daba553cb8b5\">Beyond the Material</h2>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ecab4586-57a4-4486-9228-de7efdbb1030\">Beyond the Material Plane, the various planes of existence are realms of myth and mystery. They're not simply other worlds, but different qualities of being, formed and governed by spiritual and elemental principles abstracted from the ordinary world.</p>\n<h3 id=\"PlanarTravel\" data-content-chunk-id=\"394788b8-46b2-4cc1-8701-8e13b7be6cb6\">Planar Travel</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"54f85963-303b-4dd1-8d0d-e456baf3873c\">When adventurers travel into other planes of existence, they are undertaking a legendary journey across the thresholds of existence to a mythic destination where they strive to complete their quest. Such a journey is the stuff of legend. Braving the realms of the dead, seeking out the celestial servants of a deity, or bargaining with an efreeti in its home city will be the subject of song and story for years to come.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"aaf70c0d-9045-4abc-be8f-47bd3d594af3\">Travel to the planes beyond the Material Plane can be accomplished in two ways: by casting a spell or by using a planar portal.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"85797de5-a449-49ce-a1bb-2b2abeb5c6fa\">Spells.&nbsp;A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to other planes of existence.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/plane-shift\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2206-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Plane shift</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/gate\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2119-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">gate</a>&nbsp;can transport adventurers directly to any other plane of existence, with different degrees of precision.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/etherealness\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2087-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Etherealness</a>&nbsp;allows adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane and travel from there to any of the planes it touches--such as the Elemental Planes. And the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/astral-projection\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2006-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">astral projection</a>&nbsp;spell lets adventurers project themselves into the Astral Plane and travel to the Outer Planes.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"86415cc3-e71d-4500-b6a0-a2fe72e426a3\">Portals.&nbsp;A portal is a general term for a stationary interplanar connection that links a specific location on one plane to a specific location on another. Some portals are like doorways, a clear window, or a fog-shrouded passage, and simply stepping through it effects the interplanar travel. Others are locations-- circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns--that exist in multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to another in turn. Some are vortices, typically joining an Elemental Plane with a very similar location on the Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano (leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the ocean (to the Plane of Water).</p>\n<h3 id=\"TransitivePlanes\" data-content-chunk-id=\"dcb8541e-7471-406c-bbd4-4518497107aa\">Transitive Planes</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1e7247b0-c9aa-4108-b4b6-15188745cae8\">The Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are called the Transitive Planes. They are mostly featureless realms that serve primarily as ways to travel from one plane to another. Spells such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/etherealness\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2087-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">etherealness</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/astral-projection\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2006-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">astral projection</a>&nbsp;allow characters to enter these planes and traverse them to reach the planes beyond.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"cb1a0520-84da-4b10-9c51-918b4d318019\">The&nbsp;Ethereal Plane&nbsp;is a misty, fog-bound dimension that is sometimes described as a great ocean. Its shores, called the Border Ethereal, overlap the Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that every location on those planes has a corresponding location on the Ethereal Plane. Certain creatures can see into the Border Ethereal, and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/see-invisibility\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2242-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">see invisibility</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/true-seeing\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2286-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">true seeing</a>&nbsp;spell grant that ability. Some magical effects also extend from the Material Plane into the Border Ethereal, particularly effects that use force energy such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/forcecage\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2114-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">forcecage</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wall-of-force\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2292-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">wall of force</a>. The depths of the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are a region of swirling mists and colorful fogs.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"377c4f17-3c35-4152-92d5-9c4e3f1745a1\">The&nbsp;Astral Plane&nbsp;is the realm of thought and dream, where visitors travel as disembodied souls to reach the planes of the divine and demonic. It is a great, silvery sea, the same above and below, with swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among motes of light resembling distant stars. Erratic whirlpools of color flicker in midair like spinning coins. Occasional bits of solid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open domain.</p>\n<h3 id=\"InnerPlanes\" data-content-chunk-id=\"3ca797f5-3b70-45ae-a313-7ffe352b60cf\">Inner Planes</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"073797de-0cc5-42ca-b0a9-8b3d88049ad6\">The Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material Plane and its echoes, providing the raw elemental substance from which all the worlds were made. The four&nbsp;Elemental Planes--Air, Earth, Fire, and Water--form a ring around the Material Plane, suspended within the churning&nbsp;Elemental Chaos.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4dd956fb-c089-4b7c-a8e3-3b555f8645c1\">At their innermost edges, where they are closest to the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal geographical sense), the four Elemental Planes resemble a world in the Material Plane. The four elements mingle together as they do in the Material Plane, forming land, sea, and sky. Farther from the Material Plane, though, the Elemental Planes are both alien and hostile. Here, the elements exist in their purest form--great expanses of solid earth, blazing fire, crystal-clear water, and unsullied air. These regions are little-known, so when discussing the Plane of Fire, for example, a speaker usually means just the border region. At the farthest extents of the Inner Planes, the pure elements dissolve and bleed together into an unending tumult of clashing energies and colliding substance, the Elemental Chaos.</p>\n<h3 id=\"OuterPlanes\" data-content-chunk-id=\"a1906f52-ae34-4727-aa27-c78f7f79261a\">Outer Planes</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2521556a-765e-4285-bd13-3e03ebbb9580\">If the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that makes up the multiverse, the Outer Planes are the direction, thought and purpose for such construction. Accordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes as divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the Outer Planes are best known as the homes of deities.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6a21427e-2d65-4172-b885-34ed24098f76\">When discussing anything to do with deities, the language used must be highly metaphorical. Their actual homes are not literally \"places\" at all, but exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realms of thought and spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one can imagine the perceptible part of the Outer Planes as a sort of border region, while extensive spiritual regions lie beyond ordinary sensory experience.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"90063f82-2fd9-43c5-8c84-c8dbfd976f3c\">Even in those perceptible regions, appearances can be deceptive. Initially, many of the Outer Planes appear hospitable and familiar to natives of the Material Plane. But the landscape can change at the whims of the powerful forces that live on the Outer Planes. The desires of the mighty forces that dwell on these planes can remake them completely, effectively erasing and rebuilding existence itself to better fulfill their own needs.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"55dc96d6-e33c-4c41-9965-04fa39c4a274\">Distance is a virtually meaningless concept on the Outer Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes often seem quite small, but they can also stretch on to what seems like infinity. It might be possible to take a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth, in a single day--if the powers of the Hells desire it. Or it could take weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek across a single layer.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"418a8698-1764-48c5-8e69-7d53c5383487\">The most well-known Outer Planes are a group of sixteen planes that correspond to the eight alignments (excluding neutrality) and the shades of distinction between them.</p>\n<h4 id=\"UpperandLowerPlanes\" data-content-chunk-id=\"4c77bea0-5344-44dc-b478-6ad2d689d68d\">Upper and Lower&nbsp;Planes</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7ef70e55-4a27-4559-b3e8-e2cae6bb9a3a\">The planes with some element of good in their nature are called the&nbsp;Upper Planes. Celestial creatures such as angels and pegasi dwell in the Upper Planes. Planes with some element of evil are the&nbsp;Lower Planes. Fiends such as demons and devils dwell in the Lower Planes. A plane's alignment is its essence, and a character whose alignment doesn't match the plane's experiences a profound sense of dissonance there. When a good creature visits Elysium, for example (a neutral good Upper Plane), it feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature feels out of tune and more than a little uncomfortable.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Demiplanes\" data-content-chunk-id=\"65fd1d72-0876-4fe0-a8ab-ddc94599a6d4\">Demiplanes</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"41032b66-4438-4067-bc43-fe3045869125\">Demiplanes are small extradimensional spaces with their own unique rules. They are pieces of reality that don't seem to fit anywhere else. Demiplanes come into being by a variety of means. Some are created by spells, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/demiplane\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2063-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">demiplane</a>, or generated at the desire of a powerful deity or other force. They may exist naturally, as a fold of existing reality that has been pinched off from the rest of the multiverse, or as a baby universe growing in power. A given demiplane can be entered through a single point where it touches another plane. Theoretically, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/plane-shift\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2206-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">plane shift</a>&nbsp;spell can also carry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper frequency required for the tuning fork is extremely hard to acquire. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/gate\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2119-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">gate</a>&nbsp;spell is more reliable, assuming the caster knows of the demiplane.</p>","_id":"c1G72YaOXBUfc856"}

You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"85e0b366-ceec-4d89-8870-115a7e08501a\">Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you're moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.</p>\n<h3 id=\"BreakingUpYourMove\" data-content-chunk-id=\"411b1039-2fa1-4a20-873b-5de0888fe305\">Breaking Up Your Move</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e001067e-16f9-499e-b459-74f31f148758\">You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.</p>\n<h4 id=\"MovingBetweenAttacks\" data-content-chunk-id=\"8cb48731-998e-4383-a41c-0f80e3f90e89\">Moving Between Attacks</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"38c683e5-49fa-4112-a86b-b6c566ed09eb\">If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.</p>\n<h4 id=\"UsingDifferentSpeeds\" data-content-chunk-id=\"70f5597d-b547-4c5b-ae82-b304bfb02305\">Using Different Speeds</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"18c6c080-eb67-4cd4-bc3c-8127b3b2f5a8\">If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you've already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can't use the new speed during the current move.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8abe53e3-b812-4dd1-ad75-f4d33b4cf83e\">For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a wizard cast the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fly\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2111-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">fly</a>&nbsp;spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.</p>\n<h3 id=\"DifficultTerrain\" data-content-chunk-id=\"6838acbd-1f37-459f-babc-085bd60501bd\">Difficult Terrain</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6966bdd7-a6ac-443f-b690-adcad5851309\">Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous staircases--the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0c24f32d-5107-44dc-b580-442893489f5a\">Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"fbf12a4f-f338-4c72-89d7-6041e83fb76f\">Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.</p>\n<h3 id=\"BeingProne\" data-content-chunk-id=\"435ef6aa-8025-461b-b0c7-72b1d95551d1\">Being Prone</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a9c240fa-d885-4481-8897-4818d58594dc\">Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down.

Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to stand up. You can't stand up if you don't have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8783ab32-233e-4484-85eb-dbb1ac4d84ae\">To move while&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/12-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">prone</a>, you must&nbsp;crawl&nbsp;or use magic such as teleportation.

A typical Medium creature isn't 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/hobgoblin\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16925-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">hobgoblin</a>&nbsp;stands in a 5‐foot-wide doorway, other creatures can't get through unless the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/hobgoblin\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16925-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">hobgoblin</a>&nbsp;lets them.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8a986ec9-1930-486a-9fcb-a5ae2fd01e2d\">A creature's space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there's a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"729a6aed-a9d9-4b6c-b7de-122aa980e022\">Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If four Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there's little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.</p>\n<h4 id=\"SqueezingintoaSmallerSpace\" data-content-chunk-id=\"f96bc8e8-28e0-424d-94b6-60e841064726\">Squeezing into a Smaller Space</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2a5b63da-7ace-4e1f-9187-dc744eb57aec\">A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that's only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it's in the smaller space.</p>\n<blockquote data-content-chunk-id=\"aa14ab7d-aad1-4d35-bac6-5b2aebffb5a3\">\n<h6 id=\"VARIANTPLAYINGONAGRID\" data-content-chunk-id=\"c105cc14-5b4c-43dc-b0fe-b0f1ddc633d1\">VARIANT: PLAYING ON A GRID</h6>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ccf25f26-2e5f-4450-9958-5491a29199fc\">If you play out a combat using a square grid and miniatures or other tokens, follow these rules.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0b8ca8ab-c545-462b-83e9-26764a4bb722\">Squares.&nbsp;Each square on the grid represents 5 feet.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"572af666-30b2-4d02-b862-1114f987563e\">Speed.&nbsp;Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by square on the grid. This means you use your speed in 5-foot segments. This is particularly easy if you translate your speed into squares by dividing the speed by 5. For example, a speed of 30 feet translates into a speed of 6 squares.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2f19cd81-701e-420e-84c1-1c006dc5b927\">If you use a grid often, consider writing your speed in squares on your character sheet.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8f247379-ec0d-47ac-81ed-176dc97fc281\">Entering a Square.&nbsp;To enter a square, you must have at least 1 square of movement left, even if the square is diagonally adjacent to the square you&rsquo;re in. (The rule for diagonal movement sacrifices realism for the sake of smooth play. The&nbsp;Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide&nbsp;provides guidance on using a more realistic approach.)</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"29fa413a-3b74-4523-96da-e2fd45313509\">If a square costs extra movement, as a square of difficult terrain does, you must have enough movement left to pay for entering it. For example, you must have at least 2 squares of movement left to enter a square of difficult terrain.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"03bd2d66-052f-45f2-b997-fee7036249e9\">Corners.&nbsp;Diagonal movement can&rsquo;t cross the corner of a wall, large tree, or other terrain feature that fills its space.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8a153e14-0f1f-4826-a18a-ba5f22e0a345\">Ranges.&nbsp;To determine the range on a grid between two things&mdash;whether creatures or objects&mdash;start counting squares from a square adjacent to one of them and stop counting in the space of the other one. Count by the shortest route.</p>\n</blockquote>","_id":"cBjSgPDyyLegM2Ji"}

And to twist the knife, tieflings know that this is because a pact struck generations ago infused the essence of Asmodeus &mdash; overlord of the Nine Hells &mdash; into their bloodline. Their appearance and their nature are not their fault but the result of an ancient sin, for which they and their children and their children&rsquo;s children will always be held&nbsp;accountable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"InfernalBloodline\" data-content-chunk-id=\"08db1e66-e59d-4737-a7c4-8ebd60c30353\">Infernal Bloodline</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c423e92f-04b6-4e57-8293-d580c59cde53\"><a href=\"http://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/647/tiefling1.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\" data-content-chunk-id=\"d1b59cac-e748-499d-a8d7-445a59089a69\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/647/300/172/tiefling1.png\" alt=\"\" data-content-chunk-id=\"abaad7d6-9d89-46a4-bfd6-28cf27d7952e\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1d55c39e-ad00-4264-ad3f-8b40a05a0d07\">Tieflings are derived from human bloodlines, and in the broadest possible sense, they still look human. However, their infernal heritage has left a clear imprint on their appearance. Tieflings have large horns that take any of a variety of shapes: some have curling horns like a ram, others have straight and tall horns like a gazelle&rsquo;s, and some spiral upward like an antelopes&rsquo; horns. They have thick tails, four to five feet long, which lash or coil around their legs when they get upset or nervous. Their canine teeth are sharply pointed, and their eyes are solid colors &mdash; black, red, white, silver, or gold &mdash; with no visible sclera or pupil. Their skin tones cover the full range of human coloration, but also include various shades of red. Their hair, cascading down from behind their horns, is usually dark, from black or brown to dark red, blue, or purple.</p>\n<h3 id=\"SelfReliantandSuspicious\" data-content-chunk-id=\"4645b98f-ebf9-4c30-bb14-c7f05819e20d\">Self-Reliant and Suspicious</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8546d170-1770-4ff8-ba77-fc6c36b8fa65\">Tieflings subsist in small minorities found mostly in human cities or towns, often in the roughest quarters of those places, where they grow up to be swindlers, thieves, or crime lords. Sometimes they live among other minority populations in enclaves where they are treated with&nbsp;more respect.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"59eb3803-dfbb-47b2-a7c2-b32e67df86e0\">Lacking a homeland, tieflings know that they have to make their own way in the world and that they have to be strong to survive. They are not quick to trust anyone who claims to be a friend, but when a tiefling&rsquo;s companions demonstrate that they trust him or her, the tiefling learns to extend the same trust to them. And once a tiefling gives someone loyalty, the tiefling is a firm friend or ally for life.</p>\n<blockquote data-content-chunk-id=\"5c67cd7a-0472-4aa1-b853-1b5ef77f05c4\">\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0d371113-0f79-422f-8a1c-15ac19892c63\">MUTUAL MISTRUST</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d2163230-81d9-4948-bac3-0c54a8b7717b\">People tend to be suspicious of tieflings, assuming that their infernal heritage has left its mark on their personality and morality, not just their appearance. Shopkeepers keep a close eye on their goods when tieflings enter their stores, the town watch might follow a tiefling around for a while, and demagogues blame tieflings for strange happenings. The reality, though, is that a tiefling&rsquo;s bloodline doesn&rsquo;t affect his or her personality to any great degree. Years of dealing with mistrust does leave its mark on most tieflings, and they respond to it in different ways. Some choose to live up to the wicked stereotype, but others are virtuous. Most are simply very aware of how people respond to them. After dealing with this mistrust throughout youth, a tiefling often develops the ability to overcome prejudice through charm or intimidation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"TieflingNames\" data-content-chunk-id=\"6dd1a7a7-c933-4a63-ba11-f7f6def3a4f6\">Tiefling Names</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f2b10fae-cccd-4514-bd13-6dbdf68361e8\">Tiefling names fall into three broad categories. Tieflings born into another culture typically have names reflective of that culture. Some have names derived from the Infernal language, passed down through generations, that reflect their fiendish heritage. And some younger tieflings, striving to find a place in the world, adopt a name that signifies a virtue or other concept and then try to embody that concept. For some, the chosen name is a noble quest.

You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can&rsquo;t change a target&rsquo;s body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.

Worn equipment functions as normal. The DM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature&rsquo;s shape and size. Your equipment doesn&rsquo;t change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can&rsquo;t wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form.

If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter.

For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"268042bc-a076-49cb-b25c-234941bf0b05\">You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature&rsquo;s physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don&rsquo;t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"81d2ebb2-6373-4dcb-b620-6aa75b76440a\">When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect.

As an inferno rages around her foes, leathery wings spread from her back and she takes to the air.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"721f292a-83dc-4fda-ad62-994272209a6d\">Long hair whipped by a conjured wind, a half-elf spreads his arms wide and throws his head back. Lifting him momentarily off the ground, a wave of magic surges up in him, through him, and out from him in a mighty blast of lightning.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"26f8cb65-6f48-4edc-a690-67abedd54e9a\">Crouching behind a stalagmite, a halfling points a finger at a charging troglodyte. A blast of fire springs from her finger to strike the creature. She ducks back behind the rock formation with a grin, unaware that her wild magic has turned her skin bright blue.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d50dc56f-cde0-4d50-b896-4c477d79eca8\">Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces. One can&rsquo;t study sorcery as one learns a language, any more than one can learn to live a legendary life. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"RawMagic\" data-content-chunk-id=\"0c7fa9e5-24a5-4e8b-bc25-9b4afa0cb223\">Raw Magic</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6abdd58b-f2b0-478e-a3bc-703c26b67e54\">Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline infused with the magic of dragons. Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them, a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b287f90a-5103-48f9-9557-b0ed93d483f4\">The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some draconic bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes. Some sorcerers can&rsquo;t name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby&rsquo;s birth, or a taste of the water from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"febf2417-1edf-438c-8f52-005f674bc54c\">Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore that wizards rely on, nor do they rely on a patron to grant their spells as warlocks do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power.</p>\n<h3 id=\"UnexplainedPowers\" data-content-chunk-id=\"fbd5511f-6614-4465-b58c-7b377b92abf5\">Unexplained Powers</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"41533efa-c652-4060-b734-6967dd99f07a\"><a href=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/710/c3sorcerer1.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/710/300/278/c3sorcerer1.png\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5396e5b3-2e9e-4f90-a4ee-9351a8580c7b\">Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it&rsquo;s unusual to find a sorcerer who is not involved in the adventuring life in some way. People with magical power seething in their veins soon discover that the power doesn&rsquo;t like to stay quiet. A sorcerer&rsquo;s magic wants to be wielded, and it has a tendency to spill out in unpredictable ways if it isn&rsquo;t called on.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"44a0ac57-9fc5-4624-8758-7131e99c9057\">Sorcerers often have obscure or quixotic motivations driving them to adventure. Some seek a greater understanding of the magical force that infuses them, or the answer to the mystery of its origin. Others hope to find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full potential. Whatever their goals, sorcerers are every bit as useful to an adventuring party as wizards, making up for a comparative lack of breadth in their magical knowledge with enormous flexibility in using the spells they know.</p>\n<h3 id=\"CreatingaSorcerer\" data-content-chunk-id=\"83b474a4-0e27-41ec-a4e9-7b2972347376\">Creating a Sorcerer</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1af379f2-ab05-4f03-873f-bc20805a581b\">The most important question to consider when creating your sorcerer is the origin of your power. As a starting character, you&rsquo;ll choose an origin that ties to a draconic bloodline or the influence of wild magic, but the exact source of your power is up to you to decide. Is it a family curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors? Or did some extraordinary event leave you blessed with inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well?</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8fef4572-96cd-4947-8bac-d5cee19ac711\">How do you feel about the magical power coursing through you? Do you embrace it, try to master it, or revel in its unpredictable nature? Is it a blessing or a curse? Did you seek it out, or did it find you? Did you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you had? What do you intend to do with it? Perhaps you feel like you&rsquo;ve been given this power for some lofty purpose. Or you might decide that the power gives you the right to do what you want, to take what you want from those who lack such power. Perhaps your power links you to a powerful individual in the world &mdash; the fey creature that blessed you at birth, the dragon who put a drop of its blood into your veins, the lich who created you as an experiment, or the deity who chose you to carry this power.</p>\n<h4 id=\"QuickBuild\" data-content-chunk-id=\"d4170137-702e-4cd3-8586-5657cf7e8594\">Quick Build</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d728cb09-b05f-4bab-8145-0f302b38dd77\">You can make a sorcerer quickly by following these suggestions.

Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent.

At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.</p>\n<h4 id=\"DragonWings\" data-content-chunk-id=\"b8eb9f4b-eb2f-47e2-ae47-952b9050fd1c\">Dragon Wings</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e90276be-9747-469d-96bf-9bf5e78ff8d2\">At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b54b1bd9-12a2-4e9a-8710-615a8189faa9\">You can&rsquo;t manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.</p>\n<h4 id=\"DraconicPresence\" data-content-chunk-id=\"4446cf88-adb3-4ce9-8058-d4d0166ae17a\">Draconic Presence</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"07966f78-b977-412d-9a41-8ff0435acb6a\">Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/5-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">frightened</a>. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/2-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">charmed</a>&nbsp;(if you chose awe) or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/5-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">frightened</a>&nbsp;(if you chose fear) until the aura ends.

The magic of his song fortifies and emboldens them.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"50a705c7-9e1e-4d9c-af0f-dec344c502db\">Laughing as she tunes her cittern, a gnome weaves her subtle magic over the assembled nobles, ensuring that her companions&rsquo; words will be well received.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c16d0473-2353-4425-918e-d7ad1cda7f37\">Whether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves magic through words and music to inspire allies, demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create illusions, and even heal wounds.</p>\n<h3 id=\"MusicandMagic\" data-content-chunk-id=\"3b15f02c-fc88-489d-96cd-dbac01774d8f\">Music and Magic</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"48c1bfc9-66d0-4550-98a9-d3690767cca8\">In the worlds of D&amp;D, words and music are not just vibrations of air, but vocalizations with power all their own. The bard is a master of song, speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say that the multiverse was spoken into existence, that the words of the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these primordial Words of Creation still resound throughout the cosmos. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their spells and powers.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"db66efeb-2e28-4790-8aef-c4b1b17f3e66\">The greatest strength of bards is their sheer versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, using their magic to inspire their allies and hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are capable of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using their magic to bolster their swords and armor. Their spells lean toward charms and illusions rather than blatantly destructive spells. They have a wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude that lets them do almost anything well. Bards become masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting, from musical performance to esoteric knowledge.</p>\n<h3 id=\"LearningfromExperience\" data-content-chunk-id=\"91ece475-ef6c-4b8b-bcd5-d15f62e51be9\">Learning from Experience</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"014ee21e-fb55-41a9-9ce7-f77acca4970c\"><a href=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/682/c3bard2.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/682/300/299/c3bard2.png\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6f32d697-2b4e-49b8-827d-fdcccde7b872\">True bards are not common in the world. Not every minstrel singing in a tavern or jester cavorting in a royal court is a bard. Discovering the magic hidden in music requires hard study and some measure of natural talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can be hard to spot the difference between these performers and true bards, though. A bard&rsquo;s life is spent wandering across the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But a depth of knowledge, a level of musical skill, and a touch of magic set bards apart from their fellows.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8b0393a8-8425-4406-b852-e64fac4954a4\">Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and their natural desire to travel &mdash; to find new tales to tell, new skills to learn, and new discoveries beyond the horizon &mdash; makes an adventuring career a natural calling. Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange places, or encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to accompany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand. A bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal experience earns renown among other bards. Indeed, after telling so many stories about heroes accomplishing mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart and assume heroic roles themselves.</p>\n<h3 id=\"CreatingaBard\" data-content-chunk-id=\"eb9641bb-d5ec-43cc-a054-f44e2ba83110\">Creating a Bard</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"925411b6-84c9-44f5-8180-7a686aee66dd\"><a href=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/683/c3bard3.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/683/850/462/c3bard3.png\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8de9e894-9c80-40e4-a7bb-31c22e3ad2fb\">Bards thrive on stories, whether those stories are true or not. Your character&rsquo;s background and motivations are not as important as the stories that he or she tells about them. Perhaps you had a secure and mundane childhood. There&rsquo;s no good story to be told about that, so you might paint yourself as an orphan raised by a hag in a dismal swamp. Or your childhood might be worthy of a story. Some bards acquire their magical music through extraordinary means, including the inspiration of fey or other supernatural creatures.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"293414ec-bae3-4abf-9b92-414576f01f11\">Did you serve an apprenticeship, studying under a master, following the more experienced bard until you were ready to strike out on your own? Or did you attend a college where you studied bardic lore and practiced your musical magic? Perhaps you were a young runaway or orphan, befriended by a wandering bard who became your mentor. Or you might have been a spoiled noble child tutored by a master. Perhaps you stumbled into the clutches of a hag, making a bargain for a musical gift in addition to your life and freedom, but at what cost?</p>\n<h4 id=\"QuickBuild\" data-content-chunk-id=\"deade4d7-5192-423a-aecf-aba557a8d786\">Quick Build</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a82bfa00-f4fd-47c6-9d31-3ad3eb704b57\">You can make a bard quickly by following these suggestions.

data-content-chunk-id=\"06cbefb9-30fa-47fc-aed1-b25edf9c6b10\">You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music.

See&nbsp;<a title=\"Spellcasting\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\" data-content-chunk-id=\"f3e27dec-827c-4117-9760-58bd49d927fd\">chapter 10</a>&nbsp;for the general rules of spellcasting and&nbsp;<a title=\"Spells\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/spells#BardSpells\" data-content-chunk-id=\"4e3e9b91-5708-4d72-b0d4-37690cea58c4\">chapter 11</a>&nbsp;for the bard spell list.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Cantrips\" data-content-chunk-id=\"26283abc-3413-4310-ab40-67d88c84558f\">Cantrips</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"be9e11cc-5c33-476d-8ca7-58975ad5b88a\">You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.</p>\n<h4 id=\"SpellSlots\" data-content-chunk-id=\"41051c44-70ea-4f92-8b2b-0f0a8ddedadb\">Spell Slots</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2e6664ff-26a7-46d9-9749-7aa7a413c9b2\">The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&rsquo;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"11dd3302-df5f-45cd-9c77-4e5d5deeaad3\">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell&nbsp;cure wounds&nbsp;and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cure-wounds\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2056-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">cure wounds</a>&nbsp;using either slot.</p>\n<h4 id=\"SpellsKnownof1stLevelandHigher\" data-content-chunk-id=\"222b473f-444a-478a-a352-bb79e64d6e73\">Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5302adf4-58ca-4fc7-8300-bb441185a7f3\">You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"fed62a03-380f-44bb-ac0a-c4169191d66e\">The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b1b6e2d3-0927-4aed-8a00-5571a35a21d6\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<h4 id=\"SpellcastingAbility\" data-content-chunk-id=\"d92c9e72-f0e0-474d-8d66-6596df9ff7e1\">Spellcasting Ability</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a76069f6-21cb-4e1c-a3a9-1333a15ef4d1\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"cb4e0fca-dcbb-42ad-9edd-7c33c2ebbb6b\">Spell save DC&nbsp;= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"dd4e1673-900d-4f0b-a26f-f146b46b6db9\">Spell attack modifier&nbsp;= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<h4 id=\"RitualCasting\" data-content-chunk-id=\"cdc7e0b6-9346-4f3c-b4ff-b93501db9808\">Ritual Casting</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"60651522-37de-4960-9de4-45cf372e2768\">You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</p>\n<h4 id=\"SpellcastingFocus\" data-content-chunk-id=\"3c8553ea-dc48-4764-847b-e8bf7ab6192a\">Spellcasting Focus</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e96a64f0-6a8e-4329-93f3-f0e6efb529cb\">You can use a musical instrument (see chapter 5, &ldquo;<a title=\"Musical Instruments\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#MusicalInstruments\" data-content-chunk-id=\"59d6840e-efad-4cf8-8ded-ae56de9b7cf5\">Equip&shy;ment</a>&rdquo;) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.</p>\n<h3 id=\"BardicInspiration\" data-content-chunk-id=\"0b2ba857-4922-43d8-9bb6-25a930c7e898\">Bardic Inspiration</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"bb8b8aae-0503-4a62-b7be-829756ac54b6\">You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"02c4f0d0-4eed-48cb-bbc1-0e3b593461c7\">Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"fd51b63d-da71-4353-9ac8-ee20613c35d9\">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a22d1a87-8352-4c9d-af0c-d454b9e52e54\">Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"JackofAllTrades\" data-content-chunk-id=\"2519e6fc-12a9-4a9d-b147-099be315084d\">Jack of All Trades</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ea48891f-cb29-4309-9142-86a7af223577\">Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn&rsquo;t already include your proficiency bonus.</p>\n<h3 id=\"SongofRest\" data-content-chunk-id=\"9c275e19-91bc-40aa-a58f-dfdc0c10fa79\">Song of Rest</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"968d85e4-9ab4-4eba-8db1-289919f38615\">Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"30d987d6-ef90-427a-8831-9cefc5c96afe\">The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"BardCollege\" data-content-chunk-id=\"bb7bad06-51c2-4717-989b-2f4eda31fd58\">Bard College</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"04178368-f7d1-41b8-b512-6cf6b670fcda\">At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice: the College of Lore or the College of Valor, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Expertise\" data-content-chunk-id=\"8100da25-0551-4c76-89a9-c7e47f21b9b0\">Expertise</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c64b9543-a978-4e10-b7d3-35460101bf2a\">At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e93c6674-ff72-46f2-b1cf-51b704ffcb2d\">At 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.</p>\n<h3 id=\"BardAbilityScoreImprovement\" data-content-chunk-id=\"f331a5c7-0947-4e55-86f8-a762c20bfc62\">Ability Score Improvement</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d39d8ca4-c9fd-49ae-a31e-4b0584f2a43f\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can&rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<h3 id=\"FontofInspiration\" data-content-chunk-id=\"10c404eb-f87d-42ae-90cb-bef06cf81090\">Font of Inspiration</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"cd3ed673-30c8-498b-a79c-c666d366799c\">Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Countercharm\" data-content-chunk-id=\"95583952-6266-4cb8-aa68-f5f9243e25d1\">Countercharm</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4453071e-95f4-4849-9c20-4557ed5ef983\">At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/5-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">frightened</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/2-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">charmed</a>.

Choose two spells from any classes, including this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"63390c60-e77c-4ba9-b2e5-69fb50dec909\">The chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in the number in the Spells Known column of the Bard table.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"576a49ec-96b7-4eb5-a205-e973c01dcb39\">You learn two additional spells from any classes at 14th level and again at 18th level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"SuperiorInspiration\" data-content-chunk-id=\"31d82395-ea47-4ee5-b4c5-3c9fbe69e17e\">Superior Inspiration</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"fff6b8d3-28b4-4420-a293-66fa32fa1588\">At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.</p>\n<h2 id=\"BardColleges\" data-content-chunk-id=\"b1aecfe5-2438-4033-854e-20bb59e8b033\">Bard Colleges</h2>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9734584e-f52a-4371-918a-b058dc82f05b\">The way of a bard is gregarious. Bards seek each other out to swap songs and stories, boast of their accomplishments, and share their knowledge. Bards form loose associations, which they call colleges, to facilitate their gatherings and preserve their traditions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"CollegeofLore\" data-content-chunk-id=\"0c99a2b9-4f7f-496f-b3f0-2ed0f8dce316\">College of Lore</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a2ebf24d-4135-4502-be6f-f0c767492e09\">Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"be7c888a-eff0-432e-b1d1-ca0ae65152d3\">The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ce723c1a-d258-4fc6-9679-fffbd4de68d7\">The college&rsquo;s members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.</p>\n<h4 id=\"BonusProficiencies\" data-content-chunk-id=\"6b478424-6cf3-4941-b1cf-5e109aa0afa9\">Bonus Proficiencies</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3ce7924d-9a9c-4ecc-a9d5-d91010e0ba22\">When you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.</p>\n<h4 id=\"CuttingWords\" data-content-chunk-id=\"6f6cfc11-d48a-44cf-95aa-7992a83e05ae\">Cutting Words</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e9da8f7a-7628-4bd2-bf66-11001c65a61d\">Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature&rsquo;s roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can&rsquo;t hear you or if it&rsquo;s immune to being&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/2-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">charmed</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"AdditionalMagicalSecrets\" data-content-chunk-id=\"cf457ac5-dc42-4bc7-be85-c1022ee081e5\">Additional Magical Secrets</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"adf1eccc-ab42-4a26-bba1-cd258880d033\">At 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any class. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you but don&rsquo;t count against the number of bard spells you know.</p>\n<h4 id=\"PeerlessSkill\" data-content-chunk-id=\"8341455d-0f3d-4d9f-b0cf-ab87af7dac59\">Peerless Skill</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f64616da-2bba-4935-a6f5-3297180f0e2b\">Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration.

Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ec6cb3be-236e-43a8-93f0-9677f532fe13\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"ProudDragonKin\" data-content-chunk-id=\"c7702933-836a-4f16-806a-73bdda32d126\">Proud Dragon Kin</h2>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 296px;\"><a style=\"text-shadow: red 0px 0px 8px;\" href=\"http://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/635/dragonborn2.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\" data-content-chunk-id=\"e3cf1dbd-c680-4229-9a9e-81bae9f48a4a\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/635/300/314/dragonborn2.png\" alt=\"\" data-content-chunk-id=\"68e525ff-e6a4-4fdb-87c1-e5e519237437\" /></a></td>\n<td style=\"width: 395px;\">\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4f956e81-168c-4071-9a95-ae8b2c181c7e\">Dragonborn look very much like dragons standing erect in humanoid form, though they lack wings or a tail. The first dragonborn had scales of vibrant hues matching the colors of their dragon kin, but generations of interbreeding have created a more uniform appearance. Their small, fine scales are usually brass or bronze in color, sometimes ranging to scarlet, rust, gold, or copper-green. They are tall and strongly built, often standing close to 6&frac12; feet tall and weighing 300 pounds or more. Their hands and feet are strong, talonlike claws with three fingers and a thumb&nbsp;on each hand.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8709d6d7-4f64-4027-afd0-ea8d8d210fe5\">The blood of a particular type of dragon runs very strong through some dragonborn clans.

Dragonborn owe their devotion and respect to their clan above all else, even the gods. Each dragonborn&rsquo;s conduct reflects on the honor of his or her clan, and bringing dishonor to the clan can result in expulsion and exile. Each dragonborn knows his or her station and duties within the clan, and honor demands maintaining the bounds of that position.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"bac5059a-d141-43b4-b467-e23fdd4bc3bd\">A continual drive for self-improvement reflects the self-sufficiency of the race as a whole. Dragonborn value skill and excellence in all endeavors. They hate to fail, and they push themselves to extreme efforts before they give up on something. A dragonborn holds mastery of a particular skill as a lifetime goal. Members of other races who share the same commitment find it easy to earn the respect of&nbsp;a dragonborn.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b3bdae01-5710-4c01-a3f2-b5cfe05ea707\">Though all dragonborn strive to be self-sufficient, they recognize that help is sometimes needed in difficult situations. But the best source for such help is the clan, and when a clan needs help, it turns to another dragonborn clan before seeking aid from other races &mdash; or even from the gods.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b3bdae01-5710-4c01-a3f2-b5cfe05ea707\">&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote data-content-chunk-id=\"7420fa06-c07e-4f30-8039-309bdf121a0e\">\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9a6c900b-4a81-4405-9f82-1f7eeb08a5cd\">DRACONIANS</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2bced234-1205-4b29-bccc-f3e811d5196a\">In the Dragonlance setting, the followers of the evil goddess Takhisis learned a dark ritual that let them corrupt the eggs of metallic dragons, producing evil dragonborn called draconians. Five types of draconians, corresponding to the five types of metallic dragons, fought for Takhisis in the War of the Lance: auraks (gold), baaz (brass), bozak (bronze), kapak (copper), and sivak (silver).

Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Dash\" data-content-chunk-id=\"70195d8f-71db-4efe-820f-601f620c2d1f\">Dash</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"32f25854-3ca6-4afe-8790-0a87b06879b1\">When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8587443b-c938-455a-9861-09e5af6a9629\">Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Disengage\" data-content-chunk-id=\"7ce4fcbf-d933-45dc-b50f-c65d655722e9\">Disengage</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e3b5ad2f-e15e-49b4-8b09-1e1b4db7636d\">If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Dodge\" data-content-chunk-id=\"83a66323-54b2-497a-8a69-e30781a73f4e\">Dodge</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6be9a805-7af9-4e3a-be66-0dfbc0676ee7\">When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/7-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">incapacitated</a>&nbsp;or if your speed drops to 0.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Help\" data-content-chunk-id=\"55cf3e5d-7170-41b9-b534-9ce31c01f057\">Help</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9f050c08-2500-4201-b53b-ae6c8a05642b\">You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3b4fbc15-b308-4703-b2fd-7c41f9ad2564\">Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally's attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Hide\" data-content-chunk-id=\"d6a54d25-798d-4618-a3bf-84c89376d962\">Hide</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e1a3212c-7124-4432-b367-52850aec3cfd\">When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Stealth\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/5-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Stealth</a>) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the \"<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#UnseenAttackersandTargets\" data-content-chunk-id=\"be8618a6-d79b-4ed4-aba4-dd3e9c717648\">Unseen Attackers and Targets</a>\" section later in this section.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Ready\" data-content-chunk-id=\"93d0c0de-37a0-4f85-80c2-486db2777b0a\">Ready</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7cbedb62-3df7-482e-9bee-412289356aca\">Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ef9f90d3-f264-4278-a0f8-0684073c429f\">First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include \"If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I'll pull the lever that opens it,\" and \"If the goblin steps next to me, I move away.\"</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6c8b0166-9e42-42fa-9ef6-6c01381032c9\">When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2783c1c8-74e2-4b36-8eb7-2a7c4ea671e3\">When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell's magic requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/web\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2299-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">web</a>&nbsp;spell and ready&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/magic-missile\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2176-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">magic missile</a>, your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/web\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2299-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">web</a>&nbsp;spell ends, and if you take damage before you release&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/magic-missile\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2176-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">magic missile</a>&nbsp;with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Search\" data-content-chunk-id=\"6d9dba65-35cb-4be4-8b42-4bebeb155abf\">Search</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0d7b3375-3ee5-4f71-b626-66071fc2e0cb\">When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the DM might have you make a Wisdom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/14-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Perception</a>) check or an Intelligence (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Investigation\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/8-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Investigation</a>) check.</p>\n<h3 id=\"UseanObject\" data-content-chunk-id=\"bffb0450-239e-43ad-9ac9-3cca54ff0b51\">Use an Object</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8ef841f5-d5aa-4297-bc98-ec59a65c156f\">You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.</p>\n<blockquote data-content-chunk-id=\"6ead14d7-a4a7-4ab4-b96f-26763d90fa61\">\n<p id=\"improvising-an-action\" data-content-chunk-id=\"9b7dfe33-9704-4425-a942-4ef358979c55\">IMPROVISING AN ACTION</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"45ad34f7-f941-4b07-aa47-b98e0465fd73\">Your character can do things not covered by the actions in this section, such as breaking down doors, intimidating enemies, sensing weaknesses in magical defenses, or calling for a parley with a foe. The only limits to the actions you can attempt are your imagination and your character&rsquo;s ability scores.

The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don't have a bonus action to take.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"348af897-3d35-43bd-bc7e-94f2a74a6be6\">You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"66f7dccf-42b9-4dde-a0ca-44c42abe227b\">You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action's timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action.</p>\n<h4 id=\"OtherActivityonYourTurn\" data-content-chunk-id=\"79800886-be1c-4d9c-95db-e2f536bab90b\">Other Activity on Your Turn</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0f136d73-3e68-485b-a9eb-8a6de56a8dae\">Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"098b08aa-968b-4111-9693-8722d3f0dc13\">You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8f440530-7cb4-401a-8fc3-052cf5256510\">You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ec98ed5e-409a-4197-9bf6-91142f3796e9\">If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action.

The opportunity attack, described later in this section, is the most common type of reaction.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"cae4c686-dd71-4916-9bee-e60b0fce786a\">When you take a reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn.

The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"21058ed1-a71c-4983-87ff-7ddfcb16ea00\">The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d479581f-697c-4242-98f7-b57dd1f513a2\">Minimus Containment.&nbsp;The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can&rsquo;t be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1e58d822-f815-4109-a572-d9ec0c54f15f\">The special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ffa9627a-600d-41aa-a88b-c3f5ccf670d2\">Slumber.&nbsp;The target falls asleep and can&rsquo;t be awoken.

The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature&rsquo;s name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"903464ae-edc6-413f-8048-8ea7004c773b\">A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2072-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">dispel magic</a>&nbsp;spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c514b1b6-22ed-41c6-a5b0-986dc5d3d600\">You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time.

Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type. For example, an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/arrow-of-slaying\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4578-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">arrow of slaying</a>&nbsp;(dragon)&nbsp;deals extra damage not only to dragons but also other creatures of the dragon type, such as dragon turtles&nbsp;and wyverns.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"284d4a92-336d-45f2-a99c-d1d58958d3ba\">The game includes the following monster types, which have no rules of their own.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3ad9c057-73f8-44b9-aa89-12e379d3fb78\">Aberrations&nbsp;are utterly alien beings. Many of them have innate magical abilities drawn from the creature's alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world. The quintessential aberrations are aboleths, and slaadi.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3f8a7b1a-f26d-421f-b6f9-3393b005e29e\">Beasts&nbsp;are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"24891c25-0a02-49bd-9d68-ed674344f16b\">Celestials&nbsp;are creatures native to the Upper Planes. Many of them are the servants of deities, employed as messengers or agents in the mortal realm and throughout the planes. Celestials are good by nature, so the exceptional celestial who strays from a good alignment is a horrifying rarity.&nbsp;Celestials include angels, couatls, and pegasi.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5fffa8e8-8838-43ab-ab0e-af6f99c0374e\">Constructs&nbsp;are made, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought. Golems are the iconic constructs. Many creatures native to the outer plane of Mechanus, such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the raw material of the plane by the will of more powerful creatures.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"28f08673-72f9-48bc-a7a3-edbc246e6678\">Dragons&nbsp;are large reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. True dragons, including the good metallic dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have innate magic. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to true dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as wyverns and pseudodragons.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"edec6394-410a-46fd-98d0-6e3d905f1542\">Elementals&nbsp;are creatures native to the elemental planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their respective elements, including the creatures simply called elementals. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy. The races of genies, including djinn and efreet, form the most important civilizations on the elemental planes. Other elemental creatures include azers, invisible stalkers, and water weirds.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"968e36be-fb30-47dc-abb8-c288dbd9321c\">Fey&nbsp;are magical creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie. Some are also found in the Outer Planes, particularly the planes of Arborea and the Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"09ca5f4e-2424-43bd-965e-d61761df1f42\">Fiends&nbsp;are creatures of wickedness that are native to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities, but many more labor under the leadership of archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests and mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding. If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost inconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds, rakshasas, and yugoloths.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"dfe30c95-d964-40ee-8a24-cfd14993545b\">Giants&nbsp;tower over humans and their kind. They are humanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads (ettins) or deformities (fomorians). The six varieties of true giant are hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. Besides these, creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"757daadd-78e8-430f-b0da-0a7fc5e66330\">Humanoids&nbsp;are the main peoples of a fantasy gaming world, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, are the races of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e8bca1f0-7733-4a7d-ae48-286c6b009195\">Monstrosities&nbsp;are monsters in the strictest sense--frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation gone awry (such as owlbears), and others are the product of terrible curses (including minotaurs). They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures that don't fit into any other type.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1ac1d659-7a2e-4376-8291-9e1f025657b9\">Oozes&nbsp;are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognizable oozes.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e114ff66-f422-49e6-a359-12970b1216d8\">Plants&nbsp;in this context are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal creatures such as the gas spore and the myconid also fall into this category.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2f365a69-4ec3-4f31-add3-d3893603e9ef\">Undead&nbsp;are once-living creatures brought to a horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse. Undead include walking corpses, such as vampires and zombies, as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Tags\" data-content-chunk-id=\"716721f3-27b8-4eb8-b713-12a311697d09\">Tags</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"bcbb467e-a265-487b-aaca-2c4f528fcfcf\">A monster might have one or more tags appended to its type, in parentheses. For example, an orc has the humanoid (orc) type. The parenthetical tags provide additional categorization for certain creatures. The tags have no rules of their own, but something in the game, such as a magic item, might refer to them. For instance, a spear that is especially effective at fighting demons would work against any monster that has the demon tag.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Alignment\" data-content-chunk-id=\"19d8cb92-ab55-488d-9e5e-0a2ff3f996c2\">Alignment</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"de5342c1-2701-4116-a9aa-80a61bcc76d4\">A monster's alignment provides a clue to its disposition and how it behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation. For example, a chaotic evil monster might be difficult to reason with and might attack characters on sight, whereas a neutral monster might be willing to negotiate.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5866bf29-e82c-41ca-8186-612883561732\">The alignment specified in a monster's stat block is the default. Feel free to depart from it and change a monster's alignment to suit the needs of your campaign. If you want a good-aligned green dragon or an evil storm giant, there's nothing stopping you.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"af872fc9-5f62-4a40-952d-f825a2273654\">Some creatures can have&nbsp;any alignment. In other words, you choose the monster's alignment. Some monster's alignment entry indicates a tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, a berserker can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2dba747d-65ef-4fdb-b1ad-7366350d1252\">Many creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or chaos, good or evil. They don't make moral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. These creatures are unaligned, which means they don't have an alignment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ArmorClass\" data-content-chunk-id=\"0eaa1981-c2f2-4f0c-9814-63db1c92e3e8\">Armor Class</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6894c2a5-55c0-49d4-a8e9-a0839ef4539f\">A monster that wears armor or carries a shield has an Armor Class (AC) that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a monster's AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and natural armor, if any. If a monster has natural armor, wears armor, or carries a shield, this is noted in parentheses after its AC value.</p>\n<h3 id=\"HitPoints\" data-content-chunk-id=\"f993f02a-e93c-464b-ac71-f48cbc0c4f04\">Hit Points</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"bd49ffa1-1fef-4c9b-b1bb-84bf5894ae61\">A monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"739e59f4-f84a-4f56-a5ae-a76543c69803\">A monster's hit points are presented both as a die expression and as an average number. For example, a monster with 2d8 hit points has 9 hit points on average (2 &times; 4&frac12;).</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"49488051-3cd8-41f3-98d9-f9f4af640847\">A monster's size determines the die used to calculate its hit points, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table.</p>\n<h4 id=\"HitDicebySize\" data-content-chunk-id=\"f1cda6fb-ba1b-426d-b61a-c92e139bbc3b\">Hit Dice by Size</h4>\n<div>\n<table id=\"monstershitdice\" data-content-chunk-id=\"d7e63835-a815-486f-9c9d-3eadc5a643f2\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Monster Size</th>\n<th>Hit Die</th>\n<th>Avg HP per Die</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Tiny</td>\n<td>d4</td>\n<td>2 1/2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Small</td>\n<td>d6</td>\n<td>3 1/2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>d8</td>\n<td>4 1/2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>d10</td>\n<td>5 1/2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td>d12</td>\n<td>6 1/2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gargantuan</td>\n<td>d20</td>\n<td>10 1/2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"99eb050d-5d24-4d87-a9a1-dff8d6867dfb\"><br />A monster's Constitution modifier also affects the number of hit points it has. Its Constitution modifier is multiplied by the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result is added to its hit points. For example, if a monster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 hit points (average 11).</p>\n<h3 id=\"Speed\" data-content-chunk-id=\"2072a44a-6f18-403a-93de-75e4cc885ad1\">Speed</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c17e80e7-2fb3-4d25-a499-c8ab644b5ca6\">A monster's speed tells you how far it can move on its turn.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f57181bf-71e6-4212-a5e5-3dbf8180c72e\">All creatures have a walking speed, simply called the monster's speed. Creatures that have no form of ground-based locomotion have a walking speed of 0 feet. Some creatures have one or more of the following additional movement modes.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Burrow\" data-content-chunk-id=\"aa2819c1-169e-4520-adbe-e4e8e2c09b19\">Burrow</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c2dd0bb0-2608-4c4c-8e75-cceb78552311\">A monster that has a burrowing speed can use that speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A monster can't burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Climb\" data-content-chunk-id=\"56fd3b56-24e1-4231-986d-439ac9cbf692\">Climb</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b9a2b3b1-5970-4b57-9d14-798ca937abd9\">A monster that has a climbing speed can use all or part of its movement to move on vertical surfaces. The monster doesn't need to spend extra movement to climb.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Fly\" data-content-chunk-id=\"3c43b04d-fd5b-44ad-bb0d-3f6b25bd2675\">Fly</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e8170cdd-209a-45ac-b7ac-ec481f0f1f77\">A monster that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly. Some monsters have the ability to&nbsp;hover, which makes them hard to knock out of the air. Such a monster stops hovering when it dies.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Swim\" data-content-chunk-id=\"56bb47cb-0738-4797-952c-a86baaa0f130\">Swim</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ae630269-9f06-439b-8af0-4c09e32fa7e5\">A monster that has a swimming speed doesn't need to spend extra movement to swim.</p>\n<h3 id=\"AbilityScores\" data-content-chunk-id=\"6ffd732e-78fc-4d0d-a597-d4e9fad411c5\">Ability Scores</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"979ab0e4-5027-4177-8cab-91d50a9fc63e\">Every monster has six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and corresponding modifiers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"SavingThrows\" data-content-chunk-id=\"9b3f5aac-534a-41a0-936b-cabe64bfa019\">Saving Throws</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b53899ff-4ad7-4435-8252-31eebefc011c\">The Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that are adept at resisting certain kinds of effects.

The monster can see in dim light within the radius as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. The monster can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Many creatures that live underground have this special sense.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Tremorsense\" data-content-chunk-id=\"b035b154-5a39-4a05-8c70-a9410339b090\">Tremorsense</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7605014c-aff2-44b4-bd82-763761ee1302\">A monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the monster and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"71f94cf2-fe47-4d68-888f-d36cabd1256c\">Tremorsense can't be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures. Many burrowing creatures, such as ankhegs, have this special sense.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Truesight\" data-content-chunk-id=\"4a288d60-ac3a-4ba3-ad20-08a3ceca99b2\">Truesight</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"874ce874-15d5-457f-b750-026bb98f66ba\">A monster with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the monster can see into the Ethereal Plane within the same range.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Languages\" data-content-chunk-id=\"2375b2c3-840e-4bc5-847b-bd9bd7672dfe\">Languages</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a56ae404-0a2c-4429-b29e-98645e0275e8\">The languages that a monster can speak are listed in alphabetical order. Sometimes a monster can understand a language but can't speak it, and this is noted in its entry. A \"--\" indicates that a creature neither speaks nor understands any language.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Telepathy\" data-content-chunk-id=\"b7720233-1304-4f7e-a8aa-34749588ad34\">Telepathy</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e83ffd29-55b0-414e-81a6-568485276bb5\">Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a monster to communicate mentally with another creature within a specified range. The contacted creature doesn't need to share a language with the monster to communicate in this way with it, but it must be able to understand at least one language. A creature without telepathy can receive and respond to telepathic messages but can't initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a7194cd2-de2b-45d7-8cf0-a205e85016be\">A telepathic monster doesn't need to see a contacted creature and can end the telepathic contact at any time. The contact is broken as soon as the two creatures are no longer within range of each other or if the telepathic monster contacts a different creature within range. A telepathic monster can initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation without using an action, but while the monster is incapacitated, it can't initiate telepathic contact, and any current contact is terminated.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"27775281-83b3-4425-ba94-b23e60c26d2b\">A creature within the area of an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/antimagic-field\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/1999-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">antimagic field</a>&nbsp;or in any other location where magic doesn't function can't send or receive telepathic messages.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Challenge\" data-content-chunk-id=\"6a6efe8c-8890-4b63-8bb9-388d6e2f23e8\">Challenge</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2970af2e-e7a8-403b-82ea-cc9e5acd22f9\">A monster's&nbsp;challenge rating&nbsp;tells you how great a threat the monster is. An appropriately equipped and well-rested party of four adventurers should be able to defeat a monster that has a challenge rating equal to its level without suffering any deaths. For example, a party of four 3rd-level characters should find a monster with a challenge rating of 3 to be a worthy challenge, but not a deadly one.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"af6cd666-ac32-44a5-97ba-41fa697b98c6\">Monsters that are significantly weaker than 1st- level characters have a challenge rating lower than 1. Monsters with a challenge rating of 0 are insignificant except in large numbers; those with no effective attacks are worth no experience points, while those that have attacks are worth 10 XP each.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2d1a0a99-444f-45fd-82ea-27cfbc033010\">Some monsters present a greater challenge than even a typical 20th-level party can handle.

Unless noted otherwise, an innate spell of 1st level or higher is always cast at its lowest possible level and can't be cast at a higher level. If a monster has a cantrip where its level matters and no level is given, use the monster's challenge rating.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"487981bf-1775-4811-b0aa-c7093c9e3716\">An innate spell can have special rules or restrictions. For example, a drow mage can innately cast the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/levitate\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2165-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">levitate</a>&nbsp;spell, but the spell has a \"self only\" restriction, which means that the spell affects only the drow mage.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"dca572f3-6fbb-42e4-875e-0a0b567844f2\">A monster's innate spells can't be swapped out with other spells.

The spellcaster level is also used for any cantrips included in the feature.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7bc4cb59-9b2a-4779-84c0-f07e0aa9c362\">The monster has a list of spells known or prepared from a specific class. The list might also include spells from a feature in that class, such as the Divine Domain feature of the cleric or the Druid Circle feature of the druid. The monster is considered a member of that class when attuning to or using a magic item that requires membership in the class or access to its spell list.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"10c65cb0-b6e0-431a-99ea-76f3855525f3\">A monster can cast a spell from its list at a higher level if it has the spell slot to do so. For example, a drow mage with the 3rd-level&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/lightning-bolt\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2167-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">lightning bolt</a>&nbsp;spell can cast it as a 5th-level spell by using one of its 5th-level spell slots.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b785f00d-59eb-4d72-90d8-471abcf45d73\">You can change the spells that a monster knows or has prepared, replacing any spell on its spell list with a spell of the same level and from the same class list. If you do so, you might cause the monster to be a greater or lesser threat than suggested by its challenge rating.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Psionics\" data-content-chunk-id=\"874faafc-0fa9-4513-a16f-57f182dde3d8\">Psionics</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"399d75dd-4044-4761-aad9-2313a4521173\">A monster that casts spells using only the power of its mind has the psionics tag added to its Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting special trait. This tag carries no special rules of its own, but other parts of the game might refer to it. A monster that has this tag typically doesn't require any components to cast its spells.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Actions\" data-content-chunk-id=\"4c33ded1-be85-45e6-a86c-235e3e4e5baf\">Actions</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2775c384-0d18-4c3f-8e82-5d3e5a2d7486\">When a monster takes its action, it can choose from the options in the Actions section of its stat block or use one of the actions available to all creatures, such as the Dash or Hide action.</p>\n<h4 id=\"MeleeandRangedAttacks\" data-content-chunk-id=\"9e2f14d6-1d3e-47bb-a0c2-d89e8f6006ea\">Melee and Ranged Attacks</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e6738974-7b7d-4a17-a4e0-73a96ec9bc37\">The most common actions that a monster will take in combat are melee and ranged attacks. These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the \"weapon\" might be a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a claw or tail spike.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"79b1903c-e3c9-4a80-bce7-f89b1347e03e\">Creature vs. Target.&nbsp;The target of a melee or ranged attack is usually either one creature or one target, the difference being that a \"target\" can be a creature or an object.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"310e5a30-7f24-47e5-8c39-2e59d4de3f06\">Hit.&nbsp;Any damage dealt or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described after the \"Hit\" notation. You have the option of taking average damage or rolling the damage; for this reason, both the average damage and the die expression are presented.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"edb7ac57-eb4e-4bd1-80e2-5b01169ed52c\">Miss.&nbsp;If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss, that information is presented after the \"Miss:\" notation.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Multiattack\" data-content-chunk-id=\"3328149e-16c5-441a-9ea6-71d1bd071ab9\">Multiattack</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"565a7113-564d-4c76-936e-1058ed325d72\">A creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has the Multiattack action. A creature can't use Multiattack when making an opportunity attack, which must be a single melee attack.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Ammunition\" data-content-chunk-id=\"c97ad16e-9138-4ae5-81c1-272cc0362e76\">Ammunition</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ee7c5f67-5f44-4ac5-aa55-05f7878f51b2\">A monster carries enough ammunition to make its ranged attacks. You can assume that a monster has 2d4 pieces of ammunition for a thrown weapon attack, and 2d10 pieces of ammunition for a projectile weapon such as a bow or crossbow.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Reactions\" data-content-chunk-id=\"34909369-59b9-4488-8fbd-ca585b41500f\">Reactions</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"099fb552-1397-4d14-a3e0-ab625fb8eb17\">If a monster can do something special with its reaction, that information is contained here. If a creature has no special reaction, this section is absent.</p>\n<h3 id=\"LimitedUsage\" data-content-chunk-id=\"4fe6e076-e0fc-4c56-9648-88bd7c9db790\">Limited Usage</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"90ecb10c-0845-4e62-94f5-047a195c7669\">Some special abilities have restrictions on the number of times they can be used.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6470c06a-dc4d-4549-8689-982f075a6eb2\">X/Day.&nbsp;The notation \"X/Day\" means a special ability can be used X number of times and that a monster must finish a long rest to regain expended uses. For example, \"1/Day\" means a special ability can be used once and that the monster must finish a long rest to use it again.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6b34f153-346d-4e2f-a907-6a1f31974a1a\">Recharge X&ndash;Y.&nbsp;The notation \"Recharge X&ndash;Y\" means a monster can use a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the monster's turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of the special ability. The ability also recharges when the monster finishes a short or long rest.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e8ed4f05-828d-4185-ad27-e6e195979f5c\">For example, \"Recharge 5&ndash;6\" means a monster can use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the monster's turn, it regains the use of that ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e70b60ee-ea3a-4171-90b9-0eb34858e181\">Recharge after a Short or Long Rest.&nbsp;This notation means that a monster can use a special ability once and then must finish a short or long rest to use it again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"GrappleRulesforMonsters\" data-content-chunk-id=\"e4cd44b7-403a-46a4-abd8-c1c100dacba3\">Grapple Rules for Monsters</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a94b2fca-924f-4dc1-948d-4126a20da06c\">Many monsters have special attacks that allow them to quickly grapple prey. When a monster hits with such an attack, it doesn't need to make an additional ability check to determine whether the grapple succeeds, unless the attack says otherwise.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0e9e1a7c-13eb-4f9c-9e01-6e43e53cc933\">A creature&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Grappled\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/6-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">grappled</a>&nbsp;by the monster can use its action to try to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/2-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Athletics</a>) or Dexterity (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Acrobatics\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/3-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Acrobatics</a>) check against the escape DC in the monster's stat block. If no escape DC is given, assume the DC is 10 + the monster's Strength (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/2-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Athletics</a>) modifier.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Equipment\" data-content-chunk-id=\"a7d03994-1bea-456d-a52a-e593f4a013b2\">Equipment</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a4b80914-d5cd-4aea-8231-aa77c536ee9e\">A stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than armor or weapons used by a monster. A creature that customarily wears clothes, such as a humanoid, is assumed to be dressed appropriately.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5f0ec7cc-1a61-449c-916c-91c1f7df9a83\">You can equip monsters with additional gear and trinkets however you like, and you decide how much of a monster's equipment is recoverable after the creature is slain and whether any of that equipment is still usable. A battered suit of armor made for a monster is rarely usable by someone else, for instance. If a spellcasting monster needs material components to cast its spells, assume that it has the material components it needs to cast the spells in its stat block.</p>","_id":"jLPZioJr4zrWE6V0"}

Your character is a combination of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your imagination. You choose a race (such as human or halfling) and a class (such as fighter or wizard). You also invent the personality, appearance, and backstory of your character. Once completed, your character serves as your representative in the game, your avatar in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons world.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"bcb497bb-e874-4afd-a485-5da829f504a2\">Before you dive into step 1 below, think about the kind of adventurer you want to play. You might be a courageous fighter, a skulking rogue, a fervent cleric, or a flamboyant wizard. Or you might be more interested in an unconventional character, such as a brawny rogue who likes hand-to-hand combat, or a sharpshooter who picks off enemies from afar. Do you like fantasy fiction featuring dwarves or elves? Try building a character of one of those races. Do you want your character to be the toughest adventurer at the table? Consider the fighter class. If you don&rsquo;t know where else to begin, take a look at the illustrations in any Dungeons &amp; Dragons book to see what catches your interest.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5ccdb6f3-70da-4ca2-9abc-c3542e80d99a\">Once you have a character in mind, follow these steps in order, making decisions that reflect the character you want. Your conception of your character might evolve with each choice you make. What&rsquo;s important is that you come to the table with a character you&rsquo;re excited to play.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4e973485-8d9b-4116-9d2f-520dbd77ffe8\">Throughout this section, we use the term&nbsp;character sheet&nbsp;to mean whatever you use to track your character, whether it&rsquo;s a formal character sheet (like the one at the end of these rules), some form of digital record, or a piece of notebook paper. An official D&amp;D character sheet is a fine place to start until you know what information you need and how you use it during the game.</p>\n<blockquote data-content-chunk-id=\"ba9d162a-a7b7-4ae6-bd9e-c6a91afb71a3\">\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8627071f-18b3-4ffe-9cbd-c73efeeeac13\">BUILDING BRUENOR</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"30ebab75-ee57-4f3d-b47c-05af7972e495\">Each step of character creation includes an example of that step, with a player named Bob building his dwarf character, Bruenor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"1ChooseaRace\" data-content-chunk-id=\"eea0d1bc-caf9-4278-881a-2205a1035112\">1.

The most common player character races are dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans. Some races also have&nbsp;subraces, such as mountain dwarf or wood elf. The&nbsp;<a title=\"Races\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/races\" data-content-chunk-id=\"7bc49ba4-a38d-49d3-bba2-eff98a61dd4f\">Races</a>&nbsp;section provides more information about these races.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"370aba75-d05e-44c7-8405-9a488563fc00\">The race you choose contributes to your character&rsquo;s identity in an important way, by establishing a general appearance and the natural talents gained from culture and ancestry. Your character&rsquo;s race grants particular racial traits, such as special senses, proficiency with certain weapons or tools, proficiency in one or more skills, or the ability to use minor spells. These traits sometimes dovetail with the capabilities of certain classes (see step 2). For example, the racial traits of lightfoot halflings make them exceptional rogues, and high elves tend to be powerful wizards. Sometimes playing against type can be fun, too. Halfling paladins and mountain dwarf wizards, for example, can be unusual but memorable characters.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a39ea561-a154-4334-b814-2d4e85646537\">Your race also increases one or more of your ability scores, which you determine in step 3. Note these increases and remember to apply them later.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d4cee215-d892-4429-8647-bcaefa3fb45c\">Record the traits granted by your race on your character sheet.

By using inspiration, you can draw on your personality trait of compassion for the downtrodden to give you an edge in negotiating with the Beggar Prince.

The rulers of Waterdeep, Silverymoon, Neverwinter, and other free cities dominate the coalition, and all lords in the Alliance work primarily for the fate and fortune of their individual settlements.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\" data-content-chunk-id=\"4d879536-2ae0-455b-945a-a997837737ac\">Alliance agents include sophisticated bards, zealous paladins, talented mages, and grizzled warriors.

They proactively eliminate such threats by any means, fighting with pride for the glory and security of their people, and for the lords who rule over them. However, Alliance operatives are often glory hounds, looking to gain a leg up on their counterparts from other Alliance cities. The leaders of the Alliance know that the order will survive only if its members support each other, requiring a balance between pride and diplomacy. Rogue agents within the Lords&rsquo; Alliance are rare, but defections have been known to occur.</p>\n<blockquote style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\" data-content-chunk-id=\"9de3c25b-c8b9-485d-9ce7-08e30ad76050\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" data-content-chunk-id=\"bbae2275-0d33-4769-9f2e-eec44cace423\">&ldquo;Everyone wants to sleep at night and feel safe in their homes, but how many want to do what it takes to keep the tide of evil at bay?

He thought&nbsp;he saw the figure of a man striding up the path. Standing, Flint drew back into the shadow of a tall pine to see better. The man&rsquo;s walk was marked by an easy grace &mdash; an elvish grace, Flint would have said; yet the man&rsquo;s body had the thickness and tight muscles of a human, while the facial hair was definitely humankind&rsquo;s. All the dwarf could see of the man&rsquo;s face beneath a green hood was tan skin and a brownish-red beard. A longbow was slung over one shoulder and a sword hung at his left side. He was dressed in soft leather, carefully tooled in the intricate designs the elves loved. But no elf in the world of Krynn could&nbsp;grow a beard&nbsp;. . . no elf, but . . .</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"006b8dbf-78ca-47b7-bc6d-b316fbceb056\">&ldquo;Tanis?&rdquo; said Flint hesitantly as the man neared.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8b9de623-3883-4c27-b21d-736f785dd473\">&ldquo;The same.&rdquo; The newcomer&rsquo;s bearded face split in a wide grin. He held open his arms and, before the dwarf could stop him, engulfed Flint in a hug that lifted him off the ground. The dwarf clasped his old friend close for a brief instant, then, remembering his dignity, squirmed and freed himself from the half-elf&rsquo;s embrace.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4e5ffdb9-86f2-4e9d-8aa0-e520fa49bd4f\">&mdash;&nbsp;Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman,&nbsp;Dragons of Autumn Twilight</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"bc74e721-281c-433b-b401-8cab8cb4736b\">Walking in two worlds but truly belonging to neither, half-elves combine what some say are the best qualities of their elf and human parents: human curiosity, inventiveness, and ambition tempered by the refined senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes of the elves. Some half-elves live among humans, set apart by their emotional and physical differences, watching friends and loved ones age while time barely touches them. Others live with the elves, growing restless as they reach adulthood in the timeless elven realms, while their peers continue to live as children. Many half-elves, unable to fit into either society, choose lives of solitary wandering or join with other misfits and outcasts in the adventuring life.</p>\n<h3 id=\"OfTwoWorlds\" data-content-chunk-id=\"e76eaa9f-665d-44ce-b1c5-b1cfe737fb5d\">Of Two Worlds</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b06cf295-58fc-4339-bb54-a5af24c9d828\">To humans, half-elves look like elves, and to elves, they look human. In height, they&rsquo;re on par with both parents, though they&rsquo;re neither as slender as elves nor as broad as humans. They range from under 5 feet to about 6 feet tall, and from 100 to 180 pounds, with men only slightly taller and heavier than women. Half-elf men do have facial hair, and sometimes grow beards to mask their elven ancestry. Half-elven coloration and features lie somewhere between their human and elf parents, and thus show a variety even more pronounced than that found among either race. They tend to have the eyes of their elven parents.</p>\n<h3 id=\"DiplomatsorWanderers\" data-content-chunk-id=\"dae0e6c0-93e5-45c2-bf5c-de9418fe93d1\">Diplomats or Wanderers</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"762bdf7b-dfc9-4154-b490-a916a8afb5c3\"><a href=\"http://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/641/half-elf1.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\" data-content-chunk-id=\"70f5dc3d-1a14-4b12-89bd-29d8215fb096\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/641/250/400/half-elf1.png\" alt=\"\" data-content-chunk-id=\"a74986cd-d105-498a-9202-1427ef2ede63\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d10d5bd5-1915-4340-aa6b-363b10e8dcee\">Half-elves have no lands of their own, though they are welcome in human cities and somewhat less welcome in elven forests. In large cities in regions where elves and humans interact often, half-elves are sometimes numerous enough to form small communities of their own. They enjoy the company of other half-elves, the only people who truly understand what it is to live between these two worlds.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"758fe7d6-d436-41f8-8084-a320716daf3f\">In most parts of the world, though, half-elves are uncommon enough that one might live for years without meeting another. Some half-elves prefer to avoid company altogether, wandering the wilds as trappers, foresters, hunters, or adventurers and visiting civilization only rarely. Like elves, they are driven by the wanderlust that comes of their longevity. Others, in contrast, throw themselves into the thick of society, putting their charisma and social skills to great use in diplomatic roles or&nbsp;as swindlers.</p>\n<blockquote data-content-chunk-id=\"8e2c4cf1-60c9-4d34-826a-3fdfb7423e39\">\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"39e74c53-9a2a-4444-ad88-a89890a84216\">EXCELLENT AMBASSADORS</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8b6df59a-b25e-46cc-a9e0-8fe66d1742ec\">Many half-elves learn at an early age to get along with everyone, defusing hostility and finding common ground. As a race, they have elven grace without elven aloofness and human energy without human boorishness. They often make excellent ambassadors and go-betweens (except between elves and humans, since each side suspects the half-elf of favoring the other).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"HalfElfNames\" data-content-chunk-id=\"d9d30761-8bc1-4b82-ac3f-87d3af469e65\">Half-Elf Names</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b754e131-de0a-4efc-be33-c1da640e14f6\">Half-elves use either human or elven naming conventions. As if to emphasize that they don&rsquo;t really fit in to either society, half-elves raised among humans are often given elven names, and those raised among elves often take&nbsp;human names.</p>\n<h3 id=\"HalfElfTraits\" data-content-chunk-id=\"32eebc83-222f-410a-b64b-79102d1ca5cb\">Half-Elf Traits</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f44baca4-2c61-4e40-b4da-4122362d75ec\">Your half-elf character has some qualities in common with elves and some that are unique to half-elves.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3cac2743-a578-409d-aa9d-b6a89280d20a\">Ability Score Increase.&nbsp;Your Charisma score increases by 2, and two other ability scores of your choice increase by 1.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ab82c784-15d8-47d3-b378-efc6d979b6b1\">Age.&nbsp;Half-elves mature at the same rate humans do and reach adulthood around the age of 20.

They value both personal freedom and creative expression, demonstrating neither love of leaders nor desire for followers. They chafe at rules, resent others&rsquo; demands, and sometimes prove unreliable, or at least unpredictable.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7e4a369b-a971-45c6-87a4-5f13bd5ece3f\">Size.&nbsp;Half-elves are about the same size as humans, ranging from 5 to 6 feet tall.

Each ability has a score, which is a number you record on your character sheet.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d57eaa23-dd8a-449f-a2f2-ee0f30123867\">The six abilities and their use in the game are described in the&nbsp;<a title=\"Using Ability Scores\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores\" data-content-chunk-id=\"c0f08fc2-6e0c-4ee7-967c-f99a6ca19da1\">Using Ability Scores</a>&nbsp;section.

Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of the highest three dice on a piece of scratch paper. Do this five more times, so that you have six numbers. If you want to save time or don&rsquo;t like the idea of randomly determining ability scores, you can use the following scores instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8c6865f8-46ed-4516-981c-56773fae3d4a\">Now take your six numbers and write each number beside one of your character&rsquo;s six abilities to assign scores to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Afterward, make any changes to your ability scores as a result of your race choice.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"72c4e81f-253a-40fc-a75a-c1f95f3a78cb\">After assigning your ability scores, determine your&nbsp;ability modifiers&nbsp;using the Ability Scores and Modifiers table. To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the result by 2 (round down). Write the modifier next to each of your scores.</p>\n<blockquote data-content-chunk-id=\"e3cff96e-18df-435c-a0b4-821bd43c7105\">\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d05a01db-9b83-4024-b9a9-1ccfff16e8e7\">BUILDING BRUENOR, STEP 3</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"052d83fe-4ccf-4afe-9224-587da7efd1c5\">Bob decides to use the standard set of scores (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) for Bruenor&rsquo;s abilities. Since he&rsquo;s a fighter, he puts his highest score, 15, in Strength. His next-highest, 14, goes in Constitution. Bruenor might be a brash fighter, but Bob decides he wants the dwarf to be older, wiser, and a good leader, so he puts decent scores in Wisdom and Charisma. After applying his racial benefits (increasing Bruenor&rsquo;s Constitution by 2 and his Strength by 2), Bruenor&rsquo;s ability scores and modifiers look like this: Strength 17 (+3), Dexterity 10 (+0), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 8 (&ndash;1), Wisdom 13 (+1), Charisma 12 (+1).</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c1a58970-df73-4fa9-9fe7-c4b972fdc3c5\">Bob fills in Bruenor&rsquo;s final hit points: 10 + his Constitution modifier of +3, for a total of 13 hit points.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"VariantCustomizingAbilityScores\" data-content-chunk-id=\"d793cd1c-52b0-4289-bc19-9ff96e0933b2\">Variant: Customizing Ability Scores</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7e9d45ef-1908-4bb0-92b5-3770aecb9bc0\">At your Dungeon Master&rsquo;s option, you can use this variant for determining your ability scores.

The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point Cost table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 points. Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score you can end up with, before applying racial increases.

A more complicated outbreak can form the basis of one or more adventures as characters search for a cure, stop the spread of the disease, and deal with the consequences.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"919eebf7-19e9-4d1b-8103-fe86f90478f1\">A disease that does more than infect a few party members is primarily a plot device. The rules help describe the effects of the disease and how it can be cured, but the specifics of how a disease works aren't bound by a common set of rules. Diseases can affect any creature, and a given illness might or might not pass from one race or kind of creature to another. A plague might affect only constructs or undead, or sweep through a halfling neighborhood but leave other races untouched. What matters is the story you want to tell.</p>\n<h3 id=\"SampleDiseases\" data-content-chunk-id=\"45771335-c76d-4a47-b6ec-d245ae582731\">Sample Diseases</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7ae050b3-158c-41cf-b597-6f8a69783c93\">The diseases here illustrate the variety of ways disease can work in the game.

Once a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter of that particular infected creature for 24 hours.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c940c228-88da-4633-a5ab-21be8fa8ad03\">At the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6. When the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease. A creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly determined form of indefinite madness, as described in the \"<a title=\"Madness\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/running-the-game#Madness\">Madness</a>\" section.</p>\n<h4 id=\"SewerPlague\" data-content-chunk-id=\"cb666252-8844-48e2-92c8-0400ea132842\">Sewer Plague</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4def2627-c73c-4a5e-8f14-6793ce7cdf34\">Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/rat\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16991-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">rat</a>s&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/otyugh\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16973-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">otyugh</a>s.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7b06e147-a79f-4c48-9213-a48af26d08a1\">When a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, or when it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"99615ee2-41b7-48ff-8c78-beece78ec63f\">It takes 1d4 days for sewer plague's symptoms to manifest in an infected creature.

One day after infection, the creature's vision starts to become blurry. The creature takes a &minus;1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight.

Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an herbalism kit can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely.</p>","_id":"mK4UvyEhgmrCRUUc"}

For example, the rogue&rsquo;s Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1b79098c-5dac-45c0-acb0-65e5b03e2141\">By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn&rsquo;t normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don&rsquo;t add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f432c56b-d556-4e7e-819a-2fef2b900bb2\">In general, you don&rsquo;t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws.

Harper agents pride themselves on being incorruptible defenders of good, and they never hesitate to aid the oppressed. Because they prefer to work behind the scenes, they are rarely noticed as they thwart tyrants, depose rulers, and head off any growing force that is rumored to have evil intent. The Harpers has its finger on the pulse of power in the Realms and works tirelessly to even the odds for the downtrodden.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\" data-content-chunk-id=\"750b6c95-8198-4513-9b89-6b5598dc5d52\">Individual Harper agents operate alone, relying on their wits and extensive information networks to gain an advantage over their enemies. They know that knowledge is power, so gathering intelligence beforehand is paramount to their success. They are well-informed and always have access to aid, magical and otherwise. Veteran members have access to secret caches of knowledge stashed all over Faer&ucirc;n, along with trusted sources stationed in every major town and city.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\" data-content-chunk-id=\"4ce7b927-25d2-4e05-8002-af8e1eaf1b86\">The organization is always on the lookout for powerful items, expressly to keep them out of the hands of evildoers.

Rarely do they operate in the open, but on rare occasions they must, because there is no other choice. When that happens, you can be sure that a fellow Harper is watching closely, ready to emerge from the shadows and help a comrade at a moment&rsquo;s notice.</p>\n<blockquote style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\" data-content-chunk-id=\"9b172eae-c1b5-4b4e-abfe-4f0f33b1e87a\">\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\" data-content-chunk-id=\"93c3989b-8414-4973-b804-d1881fa82f29\">&ldquo;A Harper is first and foremost self-reliant, for once you are autonomous then no one can tempt you into using power as a crutch.

Members of the peasantry trade in goods, bartering for what they need and paying taxes in grain and cheese.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e6e89504-9093-4cd6-8bd9-2a8230585dd6\">Members of the nobility trade either in legal rights, such as the rights to a mine, a port, or farmland, or in gold bars, measuring gold by the pound rather than by the coin.

The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"85163d29-fae7-4dff-8f42-c8dca4a7ae47\">With one gold piece, a character can buy a bedroll, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"27b713c0-3708-42cc-b33c-7768ee19f63c\">One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for half a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a0c05e05-07ed-4ac3-8ae2-5ef97f36821b\">One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5287d373-6492-4a17-9914-c8bbada62209\">In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7e36e1c9-a049-47b7-911e-fe48857a0fc1\">A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.</p>\n<h4 id=\"StandardExchangeRates\" data-content-chunk-id=\"14bd89c0-be08-4abc-8d99-e451aa29ba99\">Standard Exchange Rates</h4>\n<div>\n<table data-content-chunk-id=\"48be9537-4247-4537-97dd-af5d0ed866d2\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Coin</th>\n<th>CP</th>\n<th>SP</th>\n<th>EP</th>\n<th>GP</th>\n<th>PP</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Copper (cp)</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1/10</td>\n<td>1/50</td>\n<td>1/100</td>\n<td>1/1,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Silver (sp)</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1/5</td>\n<td>1/10</td>\n<td>1/100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Electrum (ep)</td>\n<td>50</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1/2</td>\n<td>1/20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gold (gp)</td>\n<td>100</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1/10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Platinum (pp)</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n<td>100</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>","_id":"nMu0BnWtRngnrl5B"}

Buildings in myriad architectural styles display the diverse origins of their&nbsp;inhabitants.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"cadabe14-f7bf-4c35-89c5-9e4c53772cc9\">And the people themselves &mdash; people of varying size, shape, and color, dressed in a dazzling spectrum of styles and hues &mdash; represent many different races, from diminutive halflings and stout dwarves to majestically beautiful elves, mingling among a variety of human&nbsp;ethnicities.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"bad28bdd-9615-4923-bca8-79fffa5568d8\">Scattered among the members of these more common races are the true exotics: a hulking dragonborn here, pushing his way through the crowd, and a sly tiefling there, lurking in the shadows with mischief in her eyes. A group of gnomes laughs as one of them activates a clever wooden toy that moves of its own accord. Half-elves and half-orcs live and work alongside humans, without fully belonging to the races of either of their parents. And there, well out of the sunlight, is a lone drow &mdash; a fugitive from the subterranean expanse of the Underdark, trying to make his way in a world that fears his kind.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ChoosingaRace\" data-content-chunk-id=\"cd871a8d-35e0-42f3-a044-2ac11a7804de\">Choosing a Race</h2>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"60027572-5725-4361-a96d-89fac54f7005\">Humans are the most common people in the worlds of D&amp;D, but they live and work alongside dwarves, elves, halflings, and countless other fantastic species. Your character belongs to one of these peoples.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5f1b8c29-0b96-47b1-894b-38f45a5e743f\">Not every intelligent race of the multiverse is appropriate for a player-controlled adventurer. Dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans are the most common races to produce the sort of adventurers who make up typical parties. Dragonborn, gnomes, half-elves, half-orcs, and tieflings are less common as adventurers. Drow, a subrace of elves, are also uncommon.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c7396c34-8be6-43c3-b7be-af97d56a1ada\">Your choice of race affects many different aspects of your character. It establishes fundamental qualities that exist throughout your character&rsquo;s adventuring career. When making this decision, keep in mind the kind of character you want to play. For example, a halfling could be a good choice for a sneaky rogue, a dwarf makes a tough warrior, and an elf can be a master of&nbsp;arcane magic.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"def39ee8-a764-4030-981e-9c80c303d7d1\">Your character race not only affects your ability scores and traits but also provides the cues for building your character&rsquo;s story. Each race&rsquo;s description in this section includes information to help you roleplay a character of that race, including personality, physical appearance, features of society, and racial alignment tendencies. These details are suggestions to help you think about your character; adventurers can deviate widely from the norm for their race. It&rsquo;s worthwhile to consider why your character is different, as a helpful way to think about your character&rsquo;s background and&nbsp;personality.</p>\n<h2 id=\"RacialTraits\" data-content-chunk-id=\"c5a1c7d6-0326-46fe-bf86-1a9d31d50153\">Racial Traits</h2>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7c607bfc-6659-43ed-b77f-dbc70c1959b3\">The description of each race includes racial traits that are common to members of that race. The following entries appear among the traits of most races.</p>\n<h3 id=\"AbilityScoreIncrease\" data-content-chunk-id=\"b85e6e6d-599e-431d-b8bc-647345ee39ae\">Ability Score Increase</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f74438e2-ff20-44ef-9bd5-635e8978d820\">Every race increases one or more of a character&rsquo;s ability scores.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Age\" data-content-chunk-id=\"a8a29e13-9032-4223-a47d-25791c5dcc48\">Age</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a60af69a-9760-4b0c-856a-cb58a25e78dd\">The age entry notes the age when a member of the race is considered an adult, as well as the race&rsquo;s expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Alignment\" data-content-chunk-id=\"0f28029e-0ff7-4d92-91ce-308a89a0ff5d\">Alignment</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"15d909a7-4289-47d7-99b6-ea4a04c32f20\">Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your dwarf is chaotic, for example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help you better define your character.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Size\" data-content-chunk-id=\"d96491b8-69e1-43a5-a48e-b02d05d8e4a4\">Size</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"75fc44f6-0b82-48ce-948c-b395fdbdc0df\">Characters of most races are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons, as explained in the&nbsp;<a title=\"Equipment\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment\" data-content-chunk-id=\"96910a68-b7a5-4abb-a658-7dadd947d564\">Equipment</a>&nbsp;section.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Speed\" data-content-chunk-id=\"04544f68-4621-4150-9805-a4d7cf78f9c0\">Speed</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3eedc2be-a352-4fbe-9b5a-1fc01853d87f\">Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling (&ldquo;<a title=\"Adventuring\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/adventuring\" data-content-chunk-id=\"752263cf-b66d-44dc-8b12-4846bbb46f34\">Adventuring</a>&rdquo;) and fighting (&ldquo;<a title=\"Combat\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat\" data-content-chunk-id=\"291fd022-9b3f-470e-8fe7-f8bb0d6575f8\">Combat</a>&rdquo;).</p>\n<h3 id=\"Languages\" data-content-chunk-id=\"af266b2f-94f1-4a74-8b9a-62f308a84363\">Languages</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d2d88dd4-8acd-42b8-937a-e42035841c6f\">By virtue of your race, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages. &ldquo;<a title=\"Personality and Background\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/personality-and-background\" data-content-chunk-id=\"252bb6ef-3043-4508-85e5-73663f1c5cb8\">Personality and Background</a>&rdquo; lists the most common languages of the D&amp;D multiverse.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Subraces\" data-content-chunk-id=\"fefbace4-7636-4b1b-a621-ae6ba1f808c4\">Subraces</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a5924d3e-5e5f-477d-b388-fe755660fe0b\">Some races have subraces. Members of a subrace have the traits of the parent race in addition to the traits specified for their subrace. Relationships among subraces vary significantly from race to race and world to world. In the Dragonlance campaign setting, for example, mountain dwarves and hill dwarves live together as different clans of the same people, but in the Forgotten Realms, they live far apart in separate kingdoms and call themselves shield dwarves and gold dwarves,&nbsp;respectively.</p>","_id":"o0wFIskbF6aNowj5"}

Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won&rsquo;t set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"fd3c973f-fdc9-4c56-b3ef-d87bf02055fc\">A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area.

You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. You also can&rsquo;t appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you&rsquo;re bipedal, you can&rsquo;t use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. At any time for the duration of the spell, you can use your action to change your appearance in this way again.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3490353c-f533-44ac-b62b-073b1feb2c17\">Natural Weapons.&nbsp;You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed strikes. Finally, the natural weapon is magic and you have a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls you make using it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"AnimalFriendship\" data-content-chunk-id=\"430f9b90-0b6b-422f-b86d-b0a66c0b66f6\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/animal-friendship\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/1993-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Animal Friendship</a></h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"053c096d-f408-4faa-ba70-ab731b95b106\">1st-level enchantment</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"eb1833a0-a102-4de2-baca-1f44804151c2\">Casting Time:&nbsp;1 action</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e70dd3c8-9768-4284-8258-04cdcfeb9560\">Range:&nbsp;30 feet</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"93da2350-8db9-4e0f-b041-dde670e4158f\">Components:&nbsp;V, S, M (a morsel of food)</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"75a77f2c-4f21-4a6c-987d-9996bc309239\">Duration:&nbsp;24 hours</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"118a4cfb-ec88-4843-a37e-7c521776200c\">This spell lets you convince a beast that you mean it no harm.

Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat. You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient who matches a general description, such as &ldquo;a man or woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard&rdquo; or &ldquo;a red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat.&rdquo; You also speak a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast travels for the duration of the spell toward the specified location, covering about 50 miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger, or 25 miles for other animals.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"fefd92a4-e3ac-40af-a55d-5472264adee3\">When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature matching the description you gave. If the messenger doesn&rsquo;t reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, and the beast makes its way back to where you cast this spell.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4e054387-88db-4374-bbe8-e20be4e5852c\">At Higher Levels.&nbsp;If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3nd level or higher, the duration of the spell increases by 48 hours for each slot level above 2nd.</p>\n<h3 id=\"AnimalShapes\" data-content-chunk-id=\"6a048653-276f-4b11-8b3d-83e323e0993f\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/animal-shapes\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/1995-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Animal Shapes</a></h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d7f67942-d0b5-4071-9835-1e86eaa438d3\">8th-level transmutation</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"dfd1533b-3265-4598-9cb5-59d59cf4e1dd\">Casting Time:&nbsp;1 action</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"83ca4504-9840-4fb6-ac7b-6157503e7e35\">Range:&nbsp;30 feet</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"55645c16-732a-4b49-93f0-5adccf41ef65\">Components:&nbsp;V, S</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6bd63169-775d-4df2-8a9b-bb147078bae5\">Duration:&nbsp;Concentration, up to 24 hours</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f12ec931-510d-41b3-b718-5f226dd5cf7b\">Your magic turns others into beasts. Choose any number of willing creatures that you can see within range. You transform each target into the form of a Large or smaller beast with a challenge rating of 4 or lower. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to transform affected creatures into new forms.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d55e0e9f-de92-40a6-827f-25b92527d341\">The transformation lasts for the duration for each target, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. You can choose a different form for each target. A target&rsquo;s game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, though the target retains its alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn&rsquo;t reduce the creature&rsquo;s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn&rsquo;t knocked&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Unconscious\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/15-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">unconscious</a>. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can&rsquo;t speak or cast spells.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f17e79a6-1f05-4ba7-b78f-d5f2ab96fa08\">The target&rsquo;s gear melds into the new form.

Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within range. Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a corpse (the DM has the creature&rsquo;s game statistics).</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"22530b03-4ff4-44b5-a888-05e0d62d4190\">On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1dda3a55-7556-4a97-9707-a688cc48d0ee\">The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you&rsquo;ve given it.

On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by the spell is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the spell persists.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9f69f2e1-c890-450b-8025-8b154ef94073\">A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ArcaneEye\" data-content-chunk-id=\"18848202-43ad-4ee4-8576-0faee54b3217\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/arcane-eye\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2001-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Arcane Eye</a></h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0c3535bc-3da5-4bea-a4f2-d083500a9437\">4th-level divination</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"19571181-10f3-482c-95fb-3dbcc3300a79\">Casting Time:&nbsp;1 action</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8ffc19d5-24e1-47e1-bc70-64850e46c91f\">Range:&nbsp;30 feet</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9153454e-9eec-407e-9081-96afc3908f47\">Components:&nbsp;V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5e1640f9-dc85-47f1-b8fc-e307748c9b03\">Duration:&nbsp;Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"940f475c-29d6-46be-ade0-3f58177bc1d6\">You create an invisible, magical eye within range that hovers in the air for the duration.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f1bced70-e2fc-435b-8bc0-e628121edc7a\">You mentally receive visual information from the eye, which has normal vision and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Darkvision\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/senses/2-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">darkvision</a>&nbsp;out to 30 feet.

The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut&mdash;something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does&mdash;your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7349c31f-0c20-4dc1-89d8-5a60ffc771e8\">Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0fbac3d4-f8fc-4ede-8f1f-348bc839465e\">The spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it.

Choose an object that you can see and that isn&rsquo;t being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to deliver your message.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"eaede690-5da1-4cd6-822c-b581d4fa1a0b\">When that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so that the words appear to come from the object&rsquo;s mouth. When you cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"71f0a10c-8453-42ef-99ff-d5391dc234d0\">The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"MagicWeapon\" data-content-chunk-id=\"5d0f2f87-f0ed-4669-a3e8-3f1f92b546d6\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/magic-weapon\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2178-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Magic Weapon</a></h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"bdf25e78-c1d2-4511-aa0b-4dd0061cdac5\">2nd-level transmutation</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2dba4bbb-ccde-42b2-8ea4-43cef85b62de\">Casting Time:&nbsp;1 bonus action</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a8378c48-00ac-487a-bd38-335e8c178d6c\">Range:&nbsp;Touch</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a76678e4-5db1-4989-aaa2-63ce8ff8b03e\">Components:&nbsp;V, S</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0c849beb-07d3-4b82-aa4c-805c2cbb11e9\">Duration:&nbsp;Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6b746000-eaef-4b31-873f-4830acb9055d\">You touch a nonmagical weapon.

The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can&rsquo;t create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte&rsquo;s stench).</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"dca198e0-92a1-4c72-8640-e724d957762a\">As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c024bf25-ef17-444e-9d63-79a3a2b45750\">Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.

You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"bdef6680-e4c4-4876-9fc0-e5afa717590a\">You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root.

Yet there was an energy, a love of adventure, that sang from every page. Long into the night Liriel read, lighting candle after precious candle.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"bf112260-25c7-4c83-9426-487af1ee9b26\">She&rsquo;d never given much thought to humans, but these stories fascinated her.

Perhaps it is because of their shorter lives that they strive to achieve as much as they can in the years they are given. Or maybe they feel they have something to prove to the elder races, and that&rsquo;s why they build their mighty empires on the foundation of conquest and trade. Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of the worlds.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ABroadSpectrum\" data-content-chunk-id=\"2494f9c5-1e02-4ebb-b6c2-70f33c5189ba\">A Broad Spectrum</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3d61a1a8-10a8-4c2b-9511-999a05eaafb2\">With their penchant for migration and conquest, humans are more physically diverse than other common races. There is no typical human. An individual can stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh from 125 to 250 pounds. Human skin shades range from nearly black to very pale, and hair colors from black to blond (curly, kinky, or straight); males might sport facial hair that is sparse or thick. A lot of humans have a dash of nonhuman blood, revealing hints of elf, orc, or other lineages. Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and rarely live even a single century.</p>\n<h3 id=\"VarietyinAllThings\" data-content-chunk-id=\"a464f70c-030e-4387-810b-17739762e81e\">Variety in All Things</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"07d8bc15-8eb4-4859-af26-343f28120c60\"><a href=\"http://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/630/human1.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\" data-content-chunk-id=\"5f4abb49-96bc-472a-a66e-f105c9126d48\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/630/300/287/human1.png\" alt=\"\" data-content-chunk-id=\"e02e525e-98a9-4078-800a-2cfee48cf438\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f8bfcd39-dfc1-463d-ac0e-0ede1a55756d\">Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races. They have widely varying tastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands where they have settled. When they settle, though, they stay: they build cities to last for the ages, and great kingdoms that can persist for long centuries. An individual human might have a relatively short life span, but a human nation or culture preserves traditions with origins far beyond the reach of any single human&rsquo;s memory. They live fully in the present &mdash; making them well suited to the adventuring life &mdash; but also plan for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy. Individually and as a group, humans are adaptable opportunists, and they stay alert to changing political and social dynamics.</p>\n<h3 id=\"LastingInstitutions\" data-content-chunk-id=\"0c69aec1-75da-4f14-b0fb-7164632105e6\">Lasting Institutions</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e11222eb-111e-4ba4-8350-85a9492ab2b5\">Where a single elf or dwarf might take on the responsibility of guarding a special location or a powerful secret, humans found sacred orders and institutions for such purposes. While dwarf clans and halfling elders pass on the ancient traditions to each new generation, human temples, governments, libraries, and codes of law fix their traditions in the bedrock of history. Humans dream of immortality, but (except for those few who seek undeath or divine ascension to escape death&rsquo;s clutches) they achieve it by ensuring that they will be remembered when they are gone.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b4ff8a6f-4b74-4588-9e44-33799d099350\">Although some humans can be xenophobic, in general their societies are inclusive.

They seek to earn glory in the eyes of their fellows by amassing power, wealth, and fame. More than other people, humans champion causes rather than territories or groups.</p>\n<blockquote data-content-chunk-id=\"3bd692de-952b-4900-9030-13121753089a\">\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"54ea777f-9322-4296-a705-00b94b39ddb6\">EVERYONE'S SECOND-BEST FRIENDS</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"10beb830-ce33-499a-b356-7668cc5b4403\">Just as readily as they mix with each other, humans mingle with members of other races. They get along with almost everyone, though they might not be close to many. Humans serve as ambassadors, diplomats, magistrates, merchants, and functionaries of all kinds.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a7289bd2-6110-4458-99df-c1778d7d299d\">Dwarves.&nbsp;&ldquo;They&rsquo;re stout folk, stalwart friends, and true to their word. Their greed for gold is their downfall, though.&rdquo;</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5e56d828-4a92-4488-a97d-3ccd811d418d\">Elves.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s best not to wander into elven woods. They don&rsquo;t like intruders, and you&rsquo;ll as likely be bewitched as peppered with arrows. Still, if an elf can get past that damned racial pride and actually treat you like an equal, you can learn a lot from them.&rdquo;</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"cfc708b9-0b02-40b2-a90b-6d03cf96a50c\">Halflings.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to beat a meal in a halfling home, as long as you don&rsquo;t crack your head on the ceiling&mdash;good food and good stories in front of a nice, warm fire. If halflings had a shred of ambition, they might really amount to something.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"HumanNamesandEthnicities\" data-content-chunk-id=\"69b40326-7a18-4f5c-9160-74996c255937\">Human Names and Ethnicities</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"24dad1c1-1530-45c2-b2e0-e64508baffad\"><a href=\"http://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/631/human2.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\" data-content-chunk-id=\"5365ae27-b786-4ae9-86f0-52919a0f5fca\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/631/300/310/human2.png\" alt=\"\" data-content-chunk-id=\"605c3d2c-4fbf-4154-b85b-666513d0f427\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a555e20a-1e7d-4020-a182-8b0f98426179\">Having so much more variety than other cultures, humans as a whole have no typical names. Some human parents give their children names from other languages, such as Dwarvish or Elvish (pronounced more or less correctly), but most parents give names that are linked to their region&rsquo;s culture or to the naming traditions of their ancestors.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c8df4b94-8685-4d4c-b902-019eae1390b3\">The material culture and physical characteristics of humans can change wildly from region to region. In the Forgotten Realms, for example, the clothing, architecture, cuisine, music, and literature are different in the northwestern lands of the Silver Marches than in distant Turmish or Impiltur to the east &mdash; and even more distinctive in far-off Kara-Tur. Human physical characteristics, though, vary according to the ancient migrations of the earliest humans, so that the humans of the Silver Marches have every possible variation of coloration&nbsp;and features.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f269632b-46d6-4fff-962b-5fedbc705049\">In the Forgotten Realms, nine human ethnic groups are widely recognized, though over a dozen others are found in more localized areas of Faer&ucirc;n. These groups, and the typical names of their members, can be used as inspiration no matter which world your&nbsp;human is in.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Calishite\" data-content-chunk-id=\"90a77e1e-696c-4d23-8be5-ec90ad038a3e\">Calishite</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1f124bc6-83b7-45d2-b6cb-257402050efc\">Shorter and slighter in build than most other humans, Calishites have dusky brown skin, hair, and eyes.

Most are tall and have green or brown eyes, but these traits are hardly universal. Humans of Chondathan descent dominate the central lands of Faer&ucirc;n, around the Inner Sea.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e33b3f19-c97e-4d11-aa6a-14a59b773181\">Chondathan Names:&nbsp;(Male) Darvin, Dorn, Evendur, Gorstag, Grim, Helm, Malark, Morn, Randal, Stedd; (female) Arveene, Esvele, Jhessail, Kerri, Lureene, Miri, Rowan, Shandri, Tessele; (surnames) Amblecrown, Buckman, Dundragon, Evenwood, Greycastle, Tallstag</p>\n<h4 id=\"Damaran\" data-content-chunk-id=\"c1921c7b-3465-4326-9a32-b5cd1e974d97\">Damaran</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"aadf5f66-ffc3-4f52-b7c6-86a56442acd4\">Found primarily in the northwest of Faer&ucirc;n, Damarans are of moderate height and build, with skin hues ranging from tawny to fair. Their hair is usually brown or black, and their eye color varies widely, though brown is&nbsp;most common.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"90c104a4-df0c-4391-866a-013b28ff84e7\">Damaran Names:&nbsp;(Male) Bor, Fodel, Glar, Grigor, Igan, Ivor, Kosef, Mival, Orel, Pavel, Sergor; (female) Alethra, Kara, Katernin, Mara, Natali, Olma, Tana, Zora; (surnames) Bersk, Chernin, Dotsk, Kulenov, Marsk, Nemetsk, Shemov, Starag</p>\n<h4 id=\"Illuskan\" data-content-chunk-id=\"65f39578-db7b-49a9-ac37-a358d7180109\">Illuskan</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"44ced932-aac2-43fa-9689-80f7164c23e3\">Illuskans are tall, fair-skinned folk with blue or steely gray eyes.

Their hair ranges from black to dark brown, but in the lands where the Mulan are most prominent, nobles and many other Mulan shave off all their hair.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"95fd821d-4628-45e8-82c7-16ac50f953a9\">Mulan Names:&nbsp;(Male) Aoth, Bareris, Ehput-Ki, Kethoth, Mumed, Ramas, So-Kehur, Thazar-De, Urhur; (female) Arizima, Chathi, Nephis, Nulara, Murithi, Sefris, Thola, Umara, Zolis; (surnames) Ankhalab, Anskuld, Fezim, Hahpet, Nathandem, Sepret, Uuthrakt</p>\n<h4 id=\"Rashemi\" data-content-chunk-id=\"f49d5cc2-dcee-4a80-983d-718da759a9ed\">Rashemi</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"de788efd-e643-4a1f-83a2-5c4d5516bdae\">Most often found east of the Inner Sea and often intermingled with the Mulan, Rashemis tend to be short, stout, and muscular. They usually have dusky skin, dark eyes, and thick black hair.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"69d272c4-d3e4-4fad-946e-0a13d923cc9b\">Rashemi Names:&nbsp;(Male) Borivik, Faurgar, Jandar, Kanithar, Madislak, Ralmevik, Shaumar, Vladislak; (female) Fyevarra, Hulmarra, Immith, Imzel, Navarra, Shevarra, Tammith, Yuldra; (surnames) Chergoba, Dyernina, Iltazyara, Murnyethara, Stayanoga, Ulmokina</p>\n<h4 id=\"Shou\" data-content-chunk-id=\"f692985b-c179-45c3-b451-ae5b82a6f467\">Shou</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3e044cf8-2ac5-4adc-ab94-50565a55dd61\">The Shou are the most numerous and powerful ethnic group in Kara-Tur, far to the east of Faer&ucirc;n. They are yellowish-bronze in hue, with black hair and dark eyes. Shou surnames are usually presented before the given name.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3400567c-c891-4388-9059-1117bfc4bba3\">Shou Names:&nbsp;(Male) An, Chen, Chi, Fai, Jiang, Jun, Lian, Long, Meng, On, Shan, Shui, Wen; (female) Bai, Chao, Jia, Lei, Mei, Qiao, Shui, Tai; (surnames) Chien, Huang, Kao, Kung, Lao, Ling, Mei, Pin, Shin,&nbsp;Sum, Tan, Wan</p>\n<h4 id=\"Tethyrian\" data-content-chunk-id=\"c538c9f7-f8f1-42da-9c8a-9c81d7fa11ee\">Tethyrian</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"90546984-17e1-476d-bf7b-cc53c4309733\">Widespread along the entire Sword Coast at the western edge of Faer&ucirc;n, Tethyrians are of medium build and height, with dusky skin that tends to grow fairer the farther north they dwell. Their hair and eye color varies widely, but brown hair and blue eyes are the most common. Tethyrians primarily use Chondathan names.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Turami\" data-content-chunk-id=\"f5efcdd1-ddde-44d2-8794-254cabed2980\">Turami</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b625bf15-5a0e-4de2-a59b-de4613889f3f\">Native to the southern shore of the Inner Sea, the Turami people are generally tall and muscular, with dark mahogany skin, curly black hair, and dark eyes.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"bcbaa556-9b0d-4eff-98b7-a813cfd13b62\">Turami Names:&nbsp;(Male) Anton, Diero, Marcon, Pieron, Rimardo, Romero, Salazar, Umbero; (female) Balama, Dona, Faila, Jalana, Luisa, Marta, Quara, Selise, Vonda; (surnames) Agosto, Astorio, Calabra, Domine, Falone, Marivaldi, Pisacar, Ramondo</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"bcbaa556-9b0d-4eff-98b7-a813cfd13b62\"><a href=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/4/975/103.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/4/975/380/361/103.png\" /></a></p>\n<blockquote data-content-chunk-id=\"95cced48-838d-4c4d-a714-b63d33791bd7\">\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"64554d08-a18c-4dc3-8ed1-e83f5acd44c7\">VARIANT HUMAN TRAITS</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7efaa894-c165-4de5-ba6c-4ca56f5b2a31\">If your campaign uses the optional feat rules from&nbsp;<a title=\"Feats\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/customization-options#Feats\" data-content-chunk-id=\"9de55d12-a745-4b2b-9390-8a21280ff7b3\">chapter 6</a>, your Dungeon Master might allow these variant traits, all of which replace the human&rsquo;s Ability Score Increase trait.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5a4b9d4f-2ee5-4d2b-8b39-2c84b04fdf06\">Ability Score Increase.&nbsp;Two different ability scores of your choice increase by 1.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7e65f3f2-0f82-4483-a018-1db4d0063598\">Skills.&nbsp;You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e721cd99-816c-4c41-bc46-25b137ed7bf8\">Feat.&nbsp;You gain one feat of your choice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"HumanTraits\" data-content-chunk-id=\"de9f8f3d-10f1-4abf-b4fc-4abb28f354c4\">Human Traits</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0a5e083f-23da-4de1-b738-d4ce5fe24f68\">It&rsquo;s hard to make generalizations about humans, but your human character has&nbsp;these traits.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ac55fe75-26f2-495f-a285-7d763dc89ad4\">Ability Score Increase.&nbsp;Your ability scores each increase by 1.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b11b8388-45cc-4b56-a1f7-a8038464d786\">Age.&nbsp;Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"398e6d4a-aa0f-4916-8764-add941890a10\">Alignment.&nbsp;Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and the worst are found among them.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2d2752a7-145c-4d2c-8a55-068c217043e9\">Size.&nbsp;Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"10ac1f88-5ce8-46a9-b0a3-641efae5fb10\">Speed.&nbsp;Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"679c98bb-5ae7-4c49-bade-33aa0a28d7d0\">Languages.&nbsp;You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on.</p>\n<blockquote data-content-chunk-id=\"4f492c36-a31a-4136-8ad0-9d41ebea3750\">\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"acab916c-e223-40da-b5d5-da48cbfb7e37\">UNCOMMON RACES</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7c1b614e-ce48-435c-9685-a0440b9e6b49\">The dragonborn and the rest of the races in this chapter are uncommon. They don&rsquo;t exist in every world of D&amp;D, and even where they are found, they are less widespread than dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"bfd777ef-3882-49d4-8824-7b26b5d5f9ca\">In the cosmopolitan cities of the D&amp;D multiverse, most people hardly look twice at members of even the most exotic races. But the small towns and villages that dot the countryside are different. The common folk aren&rsquo;t accustomed to seeing members of these races, and they react accordingly.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ce8e4677-680c-4ecc-9b86-9ae11b51ed38\">Dragonborn.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s easy to assume that a dragonborn is a monster, especially if his or her scales betray a chromatic heritage. Unless the dragonborn starts breathing fire and causing destruction, though, people are likely to respond with caution rather than outright fear.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"938be5fa-cd59-4be2-b416-7fb4497e022f\">Gnome.&nbsp;Gnomes don&rsquo;t look like a threat and can quickly disarm suspicion with good humor. The common folk are often curious about gnomes, likely never having seen one before, but they are rarely hostile or fearful.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d0aed3c1-1fa7-45d3-b57a-758b6c457473\">Half-Elf.&nbsp;Although many people have never seen a half-elf, virtually everyone knows they exist. A half-elf stranger&rsquo;s arrival is followed by gossip behind the half-elf&rsquo;s back and stolen glances across the common room, rather than any confrontation or open curiosity.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7988182c-e2aa-401e-8013-8a52d5d5fa1a\">Half-Orc.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s usually safe to assume that a half-orc is belligerent and quick to anger, so people watch themselves around an unfamiliar half-orc. Shopkeepers might surreptitiously hide valuable or fragile goods when a half-orc comes in, and people slowly clear out of a tavern, assuming a fight will break out soon.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"36982562-f221-431b-a758-5917765f5c02\">Tiefling. Half-orcs are greeted with a practical caution, but tieflings are the subject of supernatural fear. The evil of their heritage is plainly visible in their features, and as far as most people are concerned, a tiefling could very well be a devil straight from the Nine Hells. People might make warding signs as a tiefling approaches, cross the street to avoid passing near, or bar shop doors before a tiefling can enter.</p>\n</blockquote>","_id":"phtEfELqg5yeAIjG"}

Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a7d70f3f-3114-478c-8baa-ae27ce29d478\">Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can&rsquo;t attack, but it can take other actions as normal.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"51419989-7e72-4ed3-9493-ee1d2a05ab64\">When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"779bfb1e-5435-4d0b-9a49-cc36ef9f19cc\">While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar&rsquo;s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9eaa922c-7556-4e21-b99d-9360b5fdbcac\">As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"dcb383fb-0bf9-4cce-ad88-da3ffb5c2be5\">You can&rsquo;t have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"cd37d369-bd79-4430-87d6-14b579993b33\">Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.</p>\n<h3 id=\"FindSteed\" data-content-chunk-id=\"7e8bdbb2-0ed9-4716-a3fe-f755b97a78c3\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/find-steed\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2098-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Find Steed</a></h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"97b9d726-3389-4997-9079-aa0bc7c08f3e\">2nd-level conjuration</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6b16126d-c608-4bf6-a084-65fa18aea42d\">Casting Time:&nbsp;10 minutes</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1f9740f1-f64e-413e-b495-c49de955e44a\">Range:&nbsp;30 feet</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7e8c751d-b924-4527-9438-0d89356fab22\">Components:&nbsp;V, S</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"cc1909b4-ce3c-40ad-8fc8-13d0e44cfcf4\">Duration:&nbsp;Instantaneous</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0441d367-6800-4575-9af2-bf5067ee63e4\">You summon a spirit that assumes the form of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed, creating a long-lasting bond with it. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the steed takes on a form that you choose: a warhorse, a pony, a camel, an elk, or a mastiff. (Your DM might allow other animals to be summoned as steeds.) The steed has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of its normal type. Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2e138549-9493-43b6-9917-68761224bf7f\">Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"03c424d9-2533-4ef6-9a63-12a58bb2e008\">When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"17eaa270-c05e-4831-b4de-5919a76cd878\">While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with&nbsp;each other telepathically.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"13e27b63-5394-4d72-a58f-754efb0e3a46\">You can&rsquo;t have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time.

If you name a destination on another plane of existence, a destination that moves (such as a mobile fortress), or a destination that isn&rsquo;t specific (such as &ldquo;a green dragon&rsquo;s lair&rdquo;), the spell fails.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8aac6e27-dd7a-4cbb-8c4e-5a14881daf53\">For the duration, as long as you are on the same plane of existence as the destination, you know how far it is and in what direction it lies. While you are traveling there, whenever you are presented with a choice of paths along the way, you automatically determine which path is the shortest and most direct route (but not necessarily the safest route) to the destination.</p>\n<h3 id=\"FindTraps\" data-content-chunk-id=\"9aae1550-6ca8-43bd-a5cb-f16d85b2703a\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/find-traps\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2100-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Find Traps</a></h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f8916e36-0511-4c02-afd4-d3cac633d7e2\">2nd-level divination</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"00100407-b965-41c8-97a2-fd51469e2738\">Casting Time:&nbsp;1 action</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"73e67d1a-48dd-43ee-83fe-92904014b2ce\">Range:&nbsp;120 feet</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5e0ea7e8-e575-47f5-8e7d-7a6b022aaa0c\">Components:&nbsp;V, S</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"57caaa55-2e56-4763-8138-b61954390a4f\">Duration:&nbsp;Instantaneous</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9cdc0cc4-444b-41af-8a25-d46e18be58b3\">You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of sight.

The prison can be a cage or a solid box, as you choose.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6cc5d23d-b350-49fc-8e95-5e184da771a7\">A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"fc7a3dcf-ddb0-4dc2-a775-eb559116af8f\">A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out from the area.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"90f748c7-0b76-498d-8390-76617a986b26\">When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage&rsquo;s area is trapped.

If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can&rsquo;t exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect.

More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9889e17c-85ec-49cc-97d2-1d1533a3b17c\">For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.</p>\n<h3 id=\"PrimalInstinct\" data-content-chunk-id=\"774c9b9d-6a0c-48c7-8e98-aa8dc8bae8c7\">Primal Instinct</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a2c76ee9-c59a-4b35-9526-3e1aabdc50d3\">People of towns and cities take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one&rsquo;s own nature was a mark of superiority. To a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace their animal nature &mdash; keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Barbarians are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands: the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes live and hunt.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"98bb0cf5-9b37-49e3-801e-eeb0802b159c\">Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ALifeofDanger\" data-content-chunk-id=\"eaac26b7-1b7a-40c5-a030-4ee52c3a89f5\">A Life of Danger</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"af46b754-2cdb-40c3-a3cf-7b44eb13db14\"><a href=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/680/c3barbarian1.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/680/300/291/c3barbarian1.png\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7a8e0f3f-ffb6-4259-bb02-d3f6172a7f5e\">Not every member of the tribes deemed &ldquo;barbarians&rdquo; by scions of civilized society has the barbarian class. A true barbarian among these people is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger so that their people don&rsquo;t have to.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"91a25dec-41e6-40c2-8536-d569d58a6c63\">Their courage in the face of danger makes barbarians perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. Some barbarians miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties.</p>\n<h3 id=\"CreatingaBarbarian\" data-content-chunk-id=\"bfb2828a-b0b2-4518-99ab-c042af59ecf0\">Creating a Barbarian</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"043b0ef4-9966-4af9-9422-d61edeb6a4f2\">When creating a barbarian character, think about where your character comes from and his or her place in the world. Talk with your DM about an appropriate origin for your barbarian. Did you come from a distant land, making you a stranger in the area of the campaign? Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier where barbarians are common?</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"204c0ebe-d9f9-4d7f-b2ed-0d566bcf4c59\">What led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to settled lands by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to &ldquo;civilized&rdquo; lands and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you committed, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.</p>\n<h4 id=\"QuickBuild\" data-content-chunk-id=\"84d6893f-2b88-4275-9d3a-58e3aaf1ebea\">Quick Build</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a62e8f34-20a2-49c8-9b11-af874f8083a8\">You can make a barbarian quickly by following these suggestions.

On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"eed0b917-73b5-434a-8c99-d30f8468c93a\">While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren&rsquo;t wearing heavy armor:</p>\n<ul data-content-chunk-id=\"8bafe98f-0929-4b39-9667-69916abe7dc2\">\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"3ff9741c-16f8-4c9e-a982-84c6b5c97179\">You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li>\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"37cb7fa5-a41d-4049-a0e3-b0c899c8413b\">When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.</li>\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"4da2dd42-c28b-49a1-84a0-f67526cb23f1\">You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e6d9468d-c5eb-4535-9e50-538369e1ab75\">If you are able to cast spells, you can&rsquo;t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"48f2ba7e-df87-4bd7-a93f-533a48f05b76\">Your rage lasts for 1 minute.

You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"adade9a3-1c7f-426b-9290-f95bd39d7fc7\">Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"BarbarianUnarmoredDefense\" data-content-chunk-id=\"900f1012-fa2d-4987-8056-85b6b0390971\">Unarmored Defense</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b6b3fbfa-5e0f-4d8d-9ec3-622565fa1b44\">While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier.

When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.</p>\n<h3 id=\"DangerSense\" data-content-chunk-id=\"2dc13e60-bd29-468f-a698-c28646b43e38\">Danger Sense</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"584c970f-8493-4f06-a5a0-0c8a56474b1e\">At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren&rsquo;t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e9051505-7972-4729-b2f3-5ec99dfeac03\">You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells.

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.</p>\n<h3 id=\"BarbarianAbilityScoreImprovement\" data-content-chunk-id=\"7d083c2f-be4c-429f-a1d0-5ea7e79eb82c\">Ability Score Improvement</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f8ddc55f-d9ab-434f-b1b5-e5ace5dcf051\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can&rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<h3 id=\"BarbarianExtraAttack\" data-content-chunk-id=\"8d3b7b07-bbd2-4363-bbbb-1833ebcc67af\">Extra Attack</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"96b35227-55e0-421f-8090-652414bcc0b0\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/actions/1-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Attack</a>&nbsp;action on your turn.</p>\n<h3 id=\"FastMovement\" data-content-chunk-id=\"78bdb6f6-6dd2-4c3c-a5c1-f1ded692ba81\">Fast Movement</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9e36f307-f89c-4ab8-9882-61990dd2508d\">Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren&rsquo;t wearing heavy armor.</p>\n<h3 id=\"FeralInstinct\" data-content-chunk-id=\"2f392d41-19ba-4bf1-b9be-4665aa99e0e8\">Feral Instinct</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b6218c2b-9fa3-4acb-b014-099c5ba6f4a4\">By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5a5a2e8f-3456-4730-b734-b8b8aa0c11af\">Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren&rsquo;t&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/7-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">incapacitated</a>, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.</p>\n<h3 id=\"BrutalCritical\" data-content-chunk-id=\"ca3fe852-c707-4460-b2b2-b11ce2b39149\">Brutal Critical</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"cf654750-075a-47a3-a566-65a0f1dbb8f0\">Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"660552fc-5057-4447-b4a2-b88e2449434e\">This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"RelentlessRage\" data-content-chunk-id=\"b2cfb7c1-75f4-4021-91ff-55a17bd604e7\">Relentless Rage</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6e1968be-8bf4-4546-a158-f9c8bc7de65a\">Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you&rsquo;re raging and don&rsquo;t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ec770485-9a97-4d7f-9d30-9fb538e29cfa\">Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.</p>\n<h3 id=\"PersistentRage\" data-content-chunk-id=\"e0180f22-be1f-43bb-9446-f81383c0e9ef\">Persistent Rage</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"54313021-9822-45a5-a1c2-99c789a536ea\">Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Unconscious\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/15-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">unconscious</a>&nbsp;or if you choose to end it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"IndomitableMight\" data-content-chunk-id=\"e3d3a4a8-e914-47fa-928e-135a33a4b8e5\">Indomitable Might</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"290a276e-83eb-4624-8eb7-1c36edbcc964\">Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.</p>\n<h3 id=\"PrimalChampion\" data-content-chunk-id=\"a1da9a19-bf89-4bf0-b975-a710c8349668\">Primal Champion</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2f79d3e7-1857-4e7d-b581-007185b5b690\">At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds.

Your maximum for those scores is now 24.</p>\n<h2 id=\"PrimalPaths\" data-content-chunk-id=\"c2a06392-f05e-4699-8acb-78bdd66f8df8\">Primal Paths</h2>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ee9f886f-5926-440e-b666-adc601d22b0d\"><a href=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/681/c3barbarian2.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/681/850/394/c3barbarian2.png\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4e713922-ce5e-488e-8609-eab8e1008009\">Rage burns in every barbarian&rsquo;s heart, a furnace that drives him or her toward greatness. Different barbarians attribute their rage to different sources, however. For some, it is an internal reservoir where pain, grief, and anger are forged into a fury hard as steel. Others see it as a spiritual blessing, a gift of a totem animal.</p>\n<h3 id=\"PathoftheBerserker\" data-content-chunk-id=\"5956da7f-33f2-4d91-b349-e40b9323456b\">Path of the Berserker</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5eca6f2a-3d58-4c49-af72-ef4ef6d9e767\">For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end &mdash; that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker&rsquo;s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Frenzy\" data-content-chunk-id=\"5e1dc10f-a917-4e89-9063-ad0594e236bb\">Frenzy</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c6d326c4-8d5a-4705-a4c0-ed9b5723e645\">Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage.

Your race, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use.

Regis was short, even by the standards of his diminutive race, with the fluff of his curly brown locks barely cresting the three-foot mark, but his belly was amply thickened by his love of a good meal, or several, as the opportunities presented themselves. The crooked stick that served as his fishing pole rose up above him, clenched between two of his toes, and hung out over the quiet lake, mirrored perfectly in the glassy surface of&nbsp;Maer Dualdon.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"513d4a84-b72f-4320-a55a-efc02422c40f\">&mdash;&nbsp;R.A. Salvatore,&nbsp;The&nbsp;Crystal Shard</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"970361b4-22ae-4a9a-96cf-e065e53586da\">The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings&rsquo; lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing fire and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation. Though some halflings live out their days in remote agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth, and home, though home might be a wagon jostling along an dirt road or a raft floating downriver.</p>\n<h3 id=\"SmallandPractical\" data-content-chunk-id=\"dfa8e906-0098-4724-81ad-cf4b5c1b65d4\">Small and Practical</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ee5ed48a-3462-45e9-a6f5-dc2bc262eecb\">The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding offense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively harmless and so have managed to survive for centuries in the shadow of empires and on the edges of wars and political strife. They are inclined to be stout, weighing between 40 and 45 pounds.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3d7be4d3-19ec-4915-b39d-c72bd08dbcc4\">Halflings&rsquo; skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy cast, and their hair is usually brown or sandy brown and wavy. They have brown or hazel eyes. Halfling men often sport long sideburns, but beards are rare among them and mustaches even more so. They like to wear simple, comfortable, and practical clothes, favoring bright colors.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b0aa65d6-d1fc-488d-9ab9-5f9319462036\">Halfling practicality extends beyond their clothing. They&rsquo;re concerned with basic needs and simple pleasures and have little use for ostentation. Even the wealthiest of halflings keep their treasures locked in a cellar rather than on display for all to see. They have&nbsp;a knack for finding the most straightforward solution&nbsp;to a problem, and have little patience for dithering.</p>\n<h3 id=\"KindandCurious\" data-content-chunk-id=\"32dc7499-a73c-442d-a1b3-fbafdc988a0f\">Kind and Curious</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"343a9ffc-2be4-47fb-aa81-cb21e9e83829\">Halflings are an affable and cheerful people. They cherish the bonds of family and friendship as well as the comforts of hearth and home, harboring few dreams of gold or glory. Even adventurers among them usually venture into the world for reasons of community, friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity. They love discovering new things, even simple things, such as an exotic food or an unfamiliar style&nbsp;of clothing.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"42bcb34a-df05-41b7-a3db-7d0f9a3dc805\">Halflings are easily moved to pity and hate to see any living thing suffer. They are generous, happily sharing what they have even in lean times.</p>\n<h3 id=\"BlendintotheCrowd\" data-content-chunk-id=\"dc7469fe-cb8a-4804-b637-3577993722a0\">Blend into the Crowd</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"453b0e52-813f-471c-b460-cd776a56c843\">Halflings are adept at fitting into a community of humans, dwarves, or elves, making themselves valuable and welcome. The combination of their inherent stealth and their unassuming nature helps halflings to avoid unwanted attention.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d8925fea-e984-473d-a42b-34ea9ce7beab\">Halflings work readily with others, and they are loyal to their friends, whether halfling or otherwise. They can display remarkable ferocity when their friends, families, or communities are threatened.</p>\n<h3 id=\"PastoralPleasantries\" data-content-chunk-id=\"1273b1ee-e7c1-4422-97c4-0e9c05f315ca\">Pastoral Pleasantries</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d8dbf962-9fb3-4f98-b52c-378d458042c2\"><a href=\"http://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/627/halfling1.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\" data-content-chunk-id=\"bca6e01c-5012-41a0-9b96-691465c810ae\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/627/400/235/halfling1.png\" alt=\"\" data-content-chunk-id=\"81cc16f4-92cf-43b5-9b03-b66b8337897e\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"459d272d-2c56-4ded-aed2-08967d603436\">Most halflings live in small, peaceful communities with large farms and well-kept groves. They rarely build kingdoms of their own or even hold much land beyond their quiet shires. They typically don&rsquo;t recognize any sort of halfling nobility or royalty, instead looking to family elders to guide them. Families preserve their traditional ways despite the rise and fall of empires.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"84753b88-cc61-42b9-87cf-e69446b88698\">Many halflings live among other races, where the halflings&rsquo; hard work and loyal outlook offer them abundant rewards and creature comforts. Some halfling communities travel as a way of life, driving wagons or guiding boats from place to place and maintaining no permanent home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ExploringOpportunities\" data-content-chunk-id=\"d4bd1092-762d-43a2-a488-d4db5cc0df73\">Exploring Opportunities</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"01c0b156-7807-4a4f-8539-bb0b7b5d2a49\">Halflings usually set out on the adventurer&rsquo;s path to defend their communities, support their friends, or explore a wide and wonder-filled world. For them, adventuring is less a career than an opportunity or sometimes&nbsp;a necessity.</p>\n<blockquote data-content-chunk-id=\"49fb386d-fbde-44ea-9162-3c5a9f7a4a19\">\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"552246fe-e8f5-423e-bf8e-fcbefaf4529e\">AFFABLE AND POSITIVE</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"922a5ea0-5c50-4434-bc21-e59e11dd59ed\">Halflings try to get along with everyone else and are loath to make sweeping generalizations &mdash; especially negative ones.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"94908654-2e67-44cd-ae94-8e977060fe94\">Dwarves.&nbsp;&ldquo;Dwarves make loyal friends, and you can count on them to keep their word. But would it hurt them to smile once in a while?&rdquo;</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8f638605-1877-432d-99ee-2aad7d6e893a\">Elves.&nbsp;&ldquo;They&rsquo;re so beautiful!

But there&rsquo;s no telling what&rsquo;s going on behind their smiling faces &mdash; surely more than they ever let on.&rdquo;</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9ec8ad2f-fdcb-4b66-afe0-64d597a030b9\">Humans.&nbsp;&ldquo;Humans are a lot like us, really. At least some of them are. Step out of the castles and keeps, go talk to the farmers and herders and you&rsquo;ll find good, solid folk. Not that there&rsquo;s anything wrong with the barons and soldiers &mdash; you have to admire their conviction. And by protecting their own lands, they protect us as well.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"HalflingNames\" data-content-chunk-id=\"8dfad86e-7628-4864-a4c9-875634b69eaf\">Halfling Names</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e3483606-1038-46a0-8a5a-5cbb10a0576a\">A halfling has a given name, a family name, and possibly a nickname.

As a rule, they are good-hearted and kind, hate to see others in pain, and have no tolerance for oppression. They are also very orderly and traditional, leaning heavily on the support of their community and the comfort of their old ways.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e05fecfe-b579-4af0-b213-2126838e1eb7\">Size.&nbsp;Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds.

The Halfling language isn&rsquo;t secret, but halflings are loath to share it with others. They write very little, so they don&rsquo;t have a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3a31fc79-43d2-4979-a177-f31bc3c7dbc5\">Subrace.&nbsp;The two main kinds of halfling, lightfoot and stout, are more like closely related families than true subraces.

Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the&nbsp;larger folk.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d2e16620-8ddc-4077-8b2e-2eddf7daba0c\">Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and groom them carefully.</p>\n<h3 id=\"LongMemoryLongGrudges\" data-content-chunk-id=\"756ac956-be20-4af9-8207-4399025c0926\">Long Memory, Long Grudges</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"fee7afe7-a743-489c-b440-72b2a4b3c35e\">Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often remember a very different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"cc313ec0-43d6-46bb-a1fa-f64ec8d143af\">Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and don&rsquo;t abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion&nbsp;to the forge.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"851de6b5-19dd-4fb7-b58a-e5d9a7e359ff\">Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf&rsquo;s entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf&rsquo;s hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ClansandKingdoms\" data-content-chunk-id=\"8edd6e27-d0c6-45cf-bc1e-fe8c0db98798\">Clans and Kingdoms</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"36bbe3c8-4e5c-4720-b1b9-3eae6e05a72f\"><a href=\"http://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/615/dwarf2.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\" data-content-chunk-id=\"f5ec035d-955b-44de-bc70-af2f3fd58d39\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/615/300/275/dwarf2.png\" alt=\"\" data-content-chunk-id=\"8b5ac8ad-f520-4791-bcf7-717aa2919607\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9797123f-0de1-4ca6-a882-ecc3644722d6\">Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry, and in some dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can&rsquo;t find in their mountains, they gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races are welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits&nbsp;even to them.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2f8a7b75-c3fd-4975-b449-b0122b29c86c\">The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves who live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan identities and affiliations, recognize related dwarves, and invoke their ancestors&rsquo; names in oaths and curses. To be clanless is the worst fate that can befall a dwarf.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a14d15cc-5286-44ba-afde-b45429040c4b\">Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, especially weaponsmiths, armorers, and jewelers. Some become mercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after for their courage&nbsp;and loyalty.</p>\n<h3 id=\"GodsGoldandClan\" data-content-chunk-id=\"733d4b4d-4389-4d6b-8e9e-08cd70fd7b58\">Gods, Gold, and Clan</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a566ff1e-9dae-42bd-b814-f9f4ad945947\"><a href=\"http://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/618/dwarf1.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\" data-content-chunk-id=\"fc3972fb-577e-4af6-950a-e8d0adacea0e\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/618/250/292/dwarf1.png\" alt=\"\" data-content-chunk-id=\"302b5960-48ee-4fe3-a3bf-9c37def8c212\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"52956a8a-d035-4d3d-bef9-3d9f6762aa1e\">Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be motivated by a desire for treasure &mdash; for its own sake, for a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to help others. Other dwarves are driven by the command or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire to bring glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might seek to restore a clan&rsquo;s lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place within the clan after having been exiled. Or a dwarf might search for the axe wielded by a mighty ancestor, lost on the field of battle centuries ago.</p>\n<blockquote data-content-chunk-id=\"235f412a-be57-460a-b041-ed7482910eab\">\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5c6c9594-bc08-4fec-8a78-02924e198a04\">SLOW TO TRUST</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5a276603-e364-4d42-8bb0-2db0903629f4\">Dwarves get along passably well with most other races. &ldquo;The difference between an acquaintance and a friend is about a hundred years,&rdquo; is a dwarf saying that might be hyperbole, but certainly points to how difficult it can be for a member of a short-lived race like humans to earn a dwarf&rsquo;s trust.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"991bb126-ba7d-4f91-a557-39c503e64465\">Elves.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not wise to depend on the elves. No telling what an elf will do next; when the hammer meets the orc&rsquo;s head, they&rsquo;re as apt to start singing as to pull out a sword. They&rsquo;re flighty and frivolous. Two things to be said for them, though: They don&rsquo;t have many smiths, but the ones they have do very fine work. And when orcs or goblins come streaming down out of the mountains, an elf&rsquo;s good to have at your back. Not as good as a dwarf, maybe, but no doubt they hate the orcs as much as we do.&rdquo;</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"be24653e-984f-4a85-b249-0f5fab445935\">Halflings.&nbsp;&ldquo;Sure, they&rsquo;re pleasant folk.

How can you take them seriously?&rdquo;</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f9472b6a-db3a-47ee-8f4e-b0b935a6e86b\">Humans.&nbsp;&ldquo;You take the time to get to know a human, and by then the human&rsquo;s on her deathbed. If you&rsquo;re lucky, she&rsquo;s got kin &mdash; a daughter or granddaughter, maybe &mdash; who&rsquo;s got hands and heart as good as hers. That&rsquo;s when you can make a human friend. And watch them go! They set their hearts on something, they&rsquo;ll get it, whether it&rsquo;s a dragon&rsquo;s hoard or an empire&rsquo;s throne.

A magic item meant to be worn must be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on the feet, gloves on the hands, hats and helmets on the head, and rings on the finger. Magic armor must be donned, a shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders. A weapon must be held.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e31876a6-2d87-4c8c-85cf-4c771a7b7317\">In most cases, a magic item that's meant to be worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build. Many magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or they magically adjust themselves to the wearer. Rare exceptions exist. If the story suggests a good reason for an item to fit only creatures of a certain size or shape, you can rule that it doesn't adjust. For example, drow-made armor might fit elves only. Dwarves might make items usable only by dwarf-sized and dwarf-shaped folk.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9ef230b0-79c2-4c2d-91ee-6ec52167851e\">When a nonhumanoid tries to wear an item, use your discretion as to whether the item functions as intended. A ring placed on a tentacle might work, but a creature with a snakelike tail instead of legs can't wear boots.</p>\n<h3 id=\"MultipleItemsoftheSameKind\" data-content-chunk-id=\"f32f3ce0-8c31-44df-9ee7-7bc5421aa401\">Multiple Items of the Same Kind</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4e8cfcd6-dc62-451b-a328-5a41b4f38d21\">Use common sense to determine whether more than one of a given kind of magic item can be worn. A character can't normally wear more than one pair of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of bracers, one suit of armor, one item of headwear, and one cloak. You can make exceptions; a character might be able to wear a circlet under a helmet, for example, or to layer two cloaks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"PairedItems\" data-content-chunk-id=\"e47bac43-d4e2-49a0-b2b2-dc62d1db14be\">Paired Items</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9a2cd406-09d0-461a-b601-48e06979b58b\">Items that come in pairs&mdash;such as boots, bracers, gauntlets, and gloves&mdash;impart their benefits only if both items of the pair are worn.

The rest of a spell entry describes the spell's effect.</p>\n<h3 id=\"CastingTime\" data-content-chunk-id=\"0243c1c1-9cc4-4d32-8255-2b7244b19dc6\">Casting Time</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0d6b10a7-661b-45a2-8247-3fcefdfe1bd7\">Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.</p>\n<h4 id=\"BonusAction\" data-content-chunk-id=\"b0871510-a1b4-46ba-b339-d091bfc40c42\">Bonus Action</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"67c1a8a9-2e17-423b-91b7-80f9c2bebe1b\">A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn. You can't cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Reactions\" data-content-chunk-id=\"9208deac-b50d-494f-92ff-2a583a3970da\">Reactions</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a00a3b24-342e-4638-8734-d6ababce548b\">Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.</p>\n<h4 id=\"LongerCastingTimes\" data-content-chunk-id=\"de805e5a-e979-401e-acff-a2a734016aae\">Longer Casting Times</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5f6ebbd6-dd56-4764-bdf1-6ed19254a5c4\">Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so. If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don't expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.</p>\n<blockquote data-content-chunk-id=\"7a1a7025-2f3c-4a69-b344-0ff68b892db8\">\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9af701bf-a6f3-4a5c-b4b3-33d23386e833\">CASTING IN ARMOR</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a0a0d158-d8b7-4985-bc4a-f1b7942066d2\">Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"Range\" data-content-chunk-id=\"fe671ecf-4af2-4bc5-b825-10deec0d4179\">Range</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ef1703bd-312f-4552-8526-cf24bc41d8ab\">The target of a spell must be within the spell's range. For a spell like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/magic-missile\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2176-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">magic missile</a>, the target is a creature. For a spell like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fireball\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2102-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">fireball</a>, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c0473f2b-d8bb-4033-93a9-fdcc2f7fad8c\">Most spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/shield\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2247-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">shield</a>&nbsp;spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"390bb100-01f7-4c44-a228-f64e4257a7d5\">Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell's effect must be you.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a038b3a3-fd93-4536-9432-8c74fe799773\">Once a spell is cast, its effects aren't limited by its range, unless the spell's description says otherwise.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Components\" data-content-chunk-id=\"1c0e8235-7378-44c7-815b-a5ea80d14031\">Components</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3aae10a1-9bb7-4b57-86f6-00f33de8b032\">A spell's components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell's description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can't provide one or more of a spell's components, you are unable to cast the spell.</p>\n<h4 id=\"VerbalV\" data-content-chunk-id=\"19abef30-6fbd-4f07-9550-d41be868bbf4\">Verbal (V)</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1391c04f-decf-41f9-987e-ff73ab699d4c\">Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren't the source of the spell's power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/silence\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2251-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">silence</a>&nbsp;spell, can't cast a spell with a verbal component.</p>\n<h4 id=\"SomaticS\" data-content-chunk-id=\"d2524b17-06f3-4eaa-87b2-dc01ce47d7e8\">Somatic (S)</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ac214b52-fe54-4c61-9a0f-8ea0cc5f85f4\">Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.</p>\n<h4 id=\"MaterialM\" data-content-chunk-id=\"e09b5dc7-1e21-432b-8305-a6af363b79ad\">Material (M)</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"becf9514-bed5-4b0c-9783-edfcc7b32ef9\">Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a&nbsp;component pouch&nbsp;or a&nbsp;spellcasting focus&nbsp;(found in &ldquo;<a title=\"Equipment\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment\" data-content-chunk-id=\"a5ba2335-65b2-4d7a-9fb7-62878425296b\">Equipment</a>&rdquo;) in place of the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a character must have that specific component before he or she can cast the spell.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c6b0d9d5-e2c2-4b2a-964b-faa814030a78\">If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell. A spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell's material components -- or to hold a spellcasting focus -- but it can be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic components.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Duration\" data-content-chunk-id=\"b6176766-173a-4d43-a6e0-b67df3c67376\">Duration</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2adb80d3-e583-4172-aad8-e70bf33675de\">A spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Instantaneous\" data-content-chunk-id=\"126df360-f065-4308-939a-342c6c90c261\">Instantaneous</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ea501ad1-0642-4f2b-bd71-187ccbf58f33\">Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can't be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Concentration\" data-content-chunk-id=\"dacfc7e9-89e2-4825-be85-1f871cc12557\">Concentration</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"10d55a8e-d58b-4d78-95ae-065ad10bfc86\">Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"20ed0cac-1c7c-4044-b252-d598d3dce49b\">If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4f7c78cd-eee3-482a-bd4c-645270e7ee59\">Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn't interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:</p>\n<ul data-content-chunk-id=\"4dcc464a-d1bc-42d1-9a78-63be2b97cf12\">\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"9c9b6604-1e27-4104-bf2a-7509afd42da0\">Casting another spell that requires concentration.&nbsp;You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can't concentrate on two spells at once.</li>\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"b3cbed2b-98ff-489a-9a68-479f1e1d12d3\">Taking damage.&nbsp;Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon's breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.</li>\n<li data-content-chunk-id=\"b52eaf4e-f785-4787-af25-de0e48dff28e\">Being incapacitated or killed.&nbsp;You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a992281f-2c7e-4b45-ac2a-cad838a382e6\">The DM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you're on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Targets\" data-content-chunk-id=\"a0852519-d3c3-4ab5-b131-c90f464e9da6\">Targets</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"536191eb-cc5a-40d4-b0e5-beabe12568cd\">A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell's magic. A spell's description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a9e69a67-b0d0-4354-96ab-e9986bbdf93c\">Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature's thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.</p>\n<h4 id=\"AClearPathtotheTarget\" data-content-chunk-id=\"75a5779e-a4e8-4592-84dd-4ba0fa4a3444\">A Clear Path to the Target</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3d080a6a-29bc-42a0-a6d6-2e1e9eed72f3\">To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can't be behind total cover. If you place an area of effect at a point that you can't see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction.</p>\n<h4 id=\"TargetingYourself\" data-content-chunk-id=\"43059efe-b430-406b-b17b-80b85ac1aec1\">Targeting Yourself</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1ec82697-ff96-46ce-87e2-5b9be8369d28\">If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself.</p>\n<aside>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"the-weave-of-magic\">THE WEAVE OF MAGIC</p>\n<p>The worlds within the D&amp;D multiverse are magical places. All existence is suffused with magical power, and potential energy lies untapped in every rock, stream, and living creature, and even in the air itself. Raw magic is the stuff of creation, the mute and mindless will of existence, permeating every bit of matter and present in every manifestation of energy throughout the multiverse.</p>\n<p>Mortals can&rsquo;t directly shape this raw magic. Instead, they make use of a fabric of magic, a kind of interface between the will of a spellcaster and the stuff of raw magic. The spellcasters of the Forgotten Realms call it the Weave and recognize its essence as the goddess Mystra, but casters have varied ways of naming and visualizing this interface. By any name, without the Weave, raw magic is locked away and inaccessible; the most powerful archmage can&rsquo;t light a candle with magic in an area where the Weave has been torn. But surrounded by the Weave, a spellcaster can shape lightning to blast foes, transport hundreds of miles in the blink of an eye, or even reverse death itself.</p>\n<p>All magic depends on the Weave, though different kinds of magic access it in a variety of ways. The spells of wizards, warlocks, sorcerers, and bards are commonly called&nbsp;arcane magic. These spells rely on an understanding&mdash;learned or intuitive&mdash;of the workings of the Weave. The caster plucks directly at the strands of the Weave to create the desired effect. Eldritch knights and arcane tricksters also use arcane magic. The spells of clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers are called&nbsp;divine magic. These spellcasters&rsquo; access to the Weave is mediated by divine power&mdash;gods, the divine forces of nature, or the sacred weight of a paladin&rsquo;s oath.</p>\n<p>Whenever a magic effect is created, the threads of the Weave intertwine, twist, and fold to make the effect possible. When characters use divination spells such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-magic\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2065-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">detect magic</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/identify\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2152-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">identify</a>, they glimpse the Weave. A spell such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2072-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">dispel magic</a>&nbsp;smooths the Weave. Spells such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/antimagic-field\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/1999-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">antimagic field</a>&nbsp;rearrange the Weave so that magic flows around, rather than through, the area affected by the spell.

Every area of effect has a&nbsp;point of origin, a location from which the spell's energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8eb305d4-8559-4bca-abc3-051bd41d52af\">A spell's effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn't included in the spell's area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Cone\" data-content-chunk-id=\"a19e9ff1-9b6b-4a01-9a8e-ee0d2b9ceb7e\">Cone</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f58e652f-e55b-4a6d-8a93-6abd1f2e5ff8\">A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone's width at a given point along its length is equal to that point's distance from the point of origin. A cone's area of effect specifies its maximum length.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7c660980-9b7c-41f5-9142-3f8ba31eb75a\">A cone's point of origin is not included in the cone's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Cube\" data-content-chunk-id=\"37402137-af14-4034-808e-6a1f5227a0b6\">Cube</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ce207457-90d0-44bd-9ece-485b0cfc1da1\">You select a cube's point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube's size is expressed as the length of each side.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4220ecf5-e08d-4734-91bc-37dced30c29e\">A cube's point of origin is not included in the cube's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Cylinder\" data-content-chunk-id=\"1b9587fe-b359-4368-b488-01a9c383c143\">Cylinder</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"dff5b655-3ebe-4a89-a88d-ff52c0884818\">A cylinder's point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell's effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0f125190-4209-4925-8100-f474569ff1e6\">A cylinder's point of origin is included in the cylinder's area of effect.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Line\" data-content-chunk-id=\"6b9ccb7d-fbcf-4219-8eed-ad677d05141a\">Line</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"fa6d4a5e-3741-4757-afa3-2b958ca8490a\">A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a6d0a6a8-0a51-4448-867d-f11b0fbb7761\">A line's point of origin is not included in the line's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Sphere\" data-content-chunk-id=\"6438e082-a347-4e22-bf37-2dc92aa238b7\">Sphere</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b67f7cd7-72b8-4c01-8078-559f25e5fd91\">You select a sphere's point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point.

Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these categories to all spells, believing that all magic functions in essentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9d508e9d-cea6-4aae-ab23-741e84037866\">The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"cee3fd9b-1efb-4c0e-bacb-6aad15cbffb5\">Abjuration&nbsp;spells are protective in nature, though some of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to other planes of existence.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"68763aa6-7961-4128-bac5-f2d95e64e613\">Conjuration&nbsp;spells involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster's side, whereas others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0cce400a-611b-41ca-be37-569d0389deaa\">Divination&nbsp;spells reveal information, whether in the form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f367b614-108d-40e1-93d2-f77989ee615c\">Enchantment&nbsp;spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another creature like a puppet.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"451c497a-e7db-448d-afaf-896297b262a1\">Evocation&nbsp;spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others channel positive energy to heal wounds.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2738aa3d-8c80-409f-ace9-d56febdf44ab\">Illusion&nbsp;spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3c387d21-2ab3-46bd-90c9-65ba4b299572\">Necromancy&nbsp;spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy from another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to life.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"399233cf-6201-46d3-a4fd-9bcb64320985\">Creating the undead through the use of necromancy spells such as animate dead is not a good act, and only evil casters use such spells frequently.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0b51b046-564a-484c-b6a8-9b0d1d3a85f9\">Transmutation&nbsp;spells change the properties of a creature, object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at the caster's command, or enhance a creature's innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"CombiningMagicalEffects\" data-content-chunk-id=\"b1890fcc-ec22-4133-b178-ee2190944ae9\">Combining Magical Effects</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"570891fd-0b53-4bc4-9bae-b044e8597cda\"><a href=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/4/974/302.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/4/974/225/296/302.png\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"30507bf2-8542-41f9-a48f-c7e1049b8d82\">The effects of different spells add together while the durations of those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times don't combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect--such as the highest bonus--from those castings applies while their durations overlap, or the most recent effect applies if the castings are equally potent and their durations overlap.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5ada1549-a390-40d4-ba26-f9f9b5090574\">For example, if two clerics cast&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/bless\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2016-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">bless</a>&nbsp;on the same target, that character gains the spell's benefit only once; he or she doesn't get to roll two bonus dice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</article>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; outline: 0px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n</section>\n</div>\n</div>","_id":"uNSz6KJttaNkH5Ei"}

You don&rsquo;t normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"223ca20e-1b26-4dc7-a63a-119ad80a4a04\">To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"56a062c0-a916-4f2d-9890-697eae97d124\">A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the DM.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4b4c2719-08c0-460a-b245-a5105f257bfc\">Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ccea9586-380d-4188-a828-ff66bc26f46a\">The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is determined by the caster&rsquo;s spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b3dce90c-80e9-42e7-92d1-a06b60e1b8db\">The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.</p>","_id":"ukTucrmb8oohNkhn"}

Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can&rsquo;t mount it if you don&rsquo;t have 15 feet of movement left or if your speed is 0.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3d41fa2e-2b3c-4c8a-b44d-33c168da0d3c\">If an effect moves your mount against its will while you&rsquo;re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you&rsquo;re knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b8efb07c-93cc-43da-a0dc-9376a64093cd\">If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ControllingaMount\" data-content-chunk-id=\"2b050298-56f6-48df-b7fb-e40d5a62ec9a\">Controlling a Mount</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"56b52347-a192-4315-85b1-450035afe733\">While you&rsquo;re mounted, you have two options. You can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6f43cb7d-1213-48bf-86e0-c4aea5f9f122\">You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f02e0a22-b64b-40bf-a5d0-ba9edd03e6b2\">An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e8976792-ac9a-4ca8-9702-1eea5f496068\">In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you&rsquo;re on it, the attacker can target you or the mount.</p>","_id":"w1iyHYGy9Xhf1kBq"}

Then she disappears into the shadows as her fighter friend moves forward to kick the door open.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5845fe2d-804b-49d4-8cf3-03efa2afb452\">A human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his accomplice prepares for her part in the ambush.

They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.</p>\n<h3 id=\"SkillandPrecision\" data-content-chunk-id=\"46dffec4-cfec-48a4-b209-b213e34beb8a\">Skill and Precision</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"15037581-59cc-41af-a77a-d5681e7c7162\">Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"cb20fbeb-05fc-4f84-9ac3-5c848bd68b1e\">When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"AShadyLiving\" data-content-chunk-id=\"5b3de5df-aad9-48b7-9131-8ba79ab24e0e\">A Shady Living</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"dae20442-1dd6-4e6a-a2db-e8e9f5cf4e5c\"><a href=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/0/708/c3rogue1.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/708/300/315/c3rogue1.png\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9338f474-9be1-4ad5-b33f-90a623ece801\">Every town and city has its share of rogues. Most of them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized into thieves&rsquo; guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues operate independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to help them in their scams and heists. A few rogues make an honest living as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can be a dangerous job in a world where dire rats &mdash; and wererats &mdash; haunt the sewers.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"75fd2957-ca9b-46a1-958f-5f79fc811779\">As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. Some are hardened criminals who decide to seek their fortune in treasure hoards, while others take up a life of adventure to escape from the law. Some have learned and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search of treasure.</p>\n<h3 id=\"CreatingaRogue\" data-content-chunk-id=\"cc78671c-36da-4697-9a3f-f76c64f0f4db\">Creating a Rogue</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a9891984-227c-4921-b4e0-9d4b2546bca8\"><a href=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/4/976/104.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/4/976/280/324/104.png\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a9891984-227c-4921-b4e0-9d4b2546bca8\">As you create your rogue character, consider the character&rsquo;s relationship to the law. Do you have a criminal past &mdash; or present? Are you on the run from the law or from an angry thieves&rsquo; guild master? Or did you leave your guild in search of bigger risks and bigger rewards? Is it greed that drives you in your adventures, or some other desire or ideal?</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"34f104a2-6aa9-42b0-aad5-874e81cdca0b\">What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe you were lucky and a successful robbery gave you the coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life. Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means of support. Or maybe you made a new friend &mdash; another member of your adventuring party &mdash; who showed you new possibilities for earning a living and employing your particular talents.</p>\n<h4 id=\"QuickBuild\" data-content-chunk-id=\"d95811bf-cd24-49d0-bf38-e58c7d7dccee\">Quick Build</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"467f5fc0-9670-4186-b437-0aa2fa057d6e\">You can make a rogue quickly by following these suggestions.

or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves&rsquo; tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"10d5d84e-d4e7-4a60-9cb9-597cd02a0ae1\">At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves&rsquo; tools) to gain this benefit.</p>\n<h3 id=\"SneakAttack\" data-content-chunk-id=\"035e8b90-b96a-47e0-aef6-9595d40dd35d\">Sneak Attack</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e6d33b3f-17bd-4cef-8343-2d25f2f6b924\">Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe&rsquo;s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d982a857-ee72-4202-a110-1988543167d4\">You don&rsquo;t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn&rsquo;t&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/7-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">incapacitated</a>, and you don&rsquo;t have disadvantage on the attack roll.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"738457ab-92e3-4c57-9146-d71be3363c7d\">The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ThievesCant\" data-content-chunk-id=\"a95008aa-f81c-4c66-bda7-4c73cbab3d55\">Thieves&rsquo; Cant</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"17d98ca4-5c79-4edc-95e2-02f24549695c\">During your rogue training you learned thieves&rsquo; cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves&rsquo; cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"27045139-9dc2-4d35-858d-0f6055d947eb\">In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves&rsquo; guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.</p>\n<h3 id=\"CunningAction\" data-content-chunk-id=\"54d542e2-7d16-4671-8151-8ebdc058b00a\">Cunning Action</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8a313b6c-3b23-48a0-b8ca-1d0cb9d4cd35\">Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly.

The Thief archetype is detailed here; see the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/classes#Rogue\">Player&rsquo;s Handbook</a>&nbsp;for other archetypes. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"RogueAbilityScoreImprovement\" data-content-chunk-id=\"49cdfd9f-56b1-44f3-8244-8848e3dc35c0\">Ability Score Improvement</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"70e38bce-3ae6-4fa5-8b43-90867cf9cbae\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can&rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<h3 id=\"UncannyDodge\" data-content-chunk-id=\"afc590b0-3f5a-45d5-bdae-38238bcddf6d\">Uncanny Dodge</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"cd44c23f-49b8-4d58-b77c-23559625aa9a\">Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack&rsquo;s damage against you.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Evasion\" data-content-chunk-id=\"2d43716a-ee67-4dda-bb34-2dd85a37b2db\">Evasion</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4ec265e2-dba8-4061-bf8d-f2f27c1f4b56\">Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon&rsquo;s fiery breath or an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/ice-storm\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2151-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">ice storm</a>&nbsp;spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ReliableTalent\" data-content-chunk-id=\"a74c23fa-f372-49de-803c-c8d98dc4f9ee\">Reliable Talent</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a043345c-d113-4634-89e2-dec6045f054a\">By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Blindsense\" data-content-chunk-id=\"488f5c24-ee0f-48c3-b8fa-8ea70b275c5b\">Blindsense</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6bf9b300-b4e0-4f04-8c39-babfc668dc52\">Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Invisible\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/8-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">invisible</a>&nbsp;creature within 10 feet of you.</p>\n<h3 id=\"SlipperyMind\" data-content-chunk-id=\"a744d042-754d-4788-9efe-96be6eb6608e\">Slippery Mind</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4b59526e-bfa9-476f-8487-7f6588cce48d\">By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Elusive\" data-content-chunk-id=\"43c94e80-75ed-4a8a-9471-b44f79be15c8\">Elusive</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5e53bb99-5730-4d01-b286-2edc8848d66f\">Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren&rsquo;t&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/conditions/7-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">incapacitated</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"StrokeofLuck\" data-content-chunk-id=\"ddd78d4d-b0e4-450a-87eb-d5e3bbdf6aa5\">Stroke of Luck</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2ec009a6-d395-480a-8747-2a032e67645c\">At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3a486216-f9a0-42c1-b596-2f4391174800\">Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h2 id=\"RoguishArchetypes\" data-content-chunk-id=\"bbc46beb-1d6a-439e-a232-1b3b3e63a33f\">Roguish Archetypes</h2>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"602751e4-c805-4303-82c2-eb17f16c09bb\">Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus &mdash; not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Thief\" data-content-chunk-id=\"66f7a97e-621b-4f11-a24e-c9ef9c3bf979\">Thief</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6f26f596-da4e-4f58-a535-883d3676ee7d\">You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn&rsquo;t employ.</p>\n<h4 id=\"FastHands\" data-content-chunk-id=\"6ff5cb70-e70d-4336-a212-09698b2e2c16\">Fast Hands</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2a3f4c6a-de81-44b5-9370-d8785879b563\">Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#SleightofHand\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/4-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Sleight of Hand</a>) check, use your thieves&rsquo; tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#UseanObject\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/actions/11-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Use an Object</a>&nbsp;action.</p>\n<h4 id=\"SecondStoryWork\" data-content-chunk-id=\"67817980-8b4e-4caa-891b-da0cde5207c2\">Second-Story Work</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a4f28c51-d538-4fc2-9a8e-08f2622c16a8\">When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d757b64d-a8ea-4133-9358-c7e04ce813ce\">In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.</p>\n<h4 id=\"SupremeSneak\" data-content-chunk-id=\"b0383f39-9db1-47fd-9233-6e2eaa90e54c\">Supreme Sneak</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"372f58a2-e699-4db4-9d9a-646fa58f5652\">Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Stealth\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/5-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Stealth</a>) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.</p>\n<h4 id=\"UseMagicDevice\" data-content-chunk-id=\"55695253-96c7-42a1-bba2-1f146508c19e\">Use Magic Device</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7a2f3861-a74b-4bbc-befd-ebcaefa941b4\">By 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of magic items.</p>\n<h4 id=\"ThiefsReflexes\" data-content-chunk-id=\"0f8cf5e2-87f0-4336-878d-65e2630f9c0c\">Thief&rsquo;s Reflexes</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4ec2afe9-9cfe-4204-9ff9-43720d3ab9f3\">When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can&rsquo;t use this feature when you are surprised.</p>","_id":"x1SV5tMzgjjAdpvQ"}
{"name":"Attunement","permission":{"default":0,"s7gxOGja1p9WAX4j":3},"flags":{},"content":"<h2 id=\"Attunement\" data-content-chunk-id=\"07877205-b86d-4be6-bd78-aa4859b2cee6\">Attunement</h2>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7de161d9-dc85-4511-a72a-fae3f36219d6\">Some magic items require a creature to form a bond with them before their magical properties can be used. This bond is called&nbsp;attunement, and certain items have a prerequisite for it. If the prerequisite is a class, a creature must be a member of that class to attune to the item. (If the class is a spellcasting class, a monster qualifies if it has spell slots and uses that class's spell list.) If the prerequisite is to be a spellcaster, a creature qualifies if it can cast at least one spell using its traits or features, not using a magic item or the like.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"bf496662-315e-42ff-b91d-6524c8cc2dc2\">Without becoming attuned to an item that requires attunement, a creature gains only its nonmagical benefits, unless its description states otherwise. For example, a magic shield that requires attunement provides the benefits of a normal shield to a creature not attuned to it, but none of its magical properties.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6631f07c-10ab-4bbc-83a0-a6801da315eb\">Attuning to an item requires a creature to spend a short rest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it (this can't be the same short rest used to learn the item's properties). This focus can take the form of weapon practice (for a weapon), meditation (for a wondrous item), or some other appropriate activity. If the short rest is interrupted, the attunement attempt fails.

You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"424d69bc-7cdd-48ab-8130-9bb6ce16cb12\">Flood.&nbsp;You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"746d1abb-5115-41ed-ba10-f8ba75da02ee\">If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave&rsquo;s path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f6ab0e21-f97e-45f9-a9aa-efe8bb139275\">The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.

The trench extends across the spell&rsquo;s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"727e756d-db18-46b7-8a87-6767b0ea987c\">Redirect Flow.&nbsp;You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell&rsquo;s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b7e061af-4c98-44da-a9e0-0be9c016e6a9\">Whirlpool.&nbsp;This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/2-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Athletics</a>) check against your spell save DC.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"49b8db1c-6652-4a36-b6c0-32e4e00cca64\">When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn&rsquo;t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/skills/2-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Athletics</a>) check to do so.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"63326579-3f24-4183-80b3-5e02a2bedde2\">The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ControlWeather\" data-content-chunk-id=\"968ec3d6-c3b8-4730-aa22-0bcd89ee9565\"><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/control-weather\" data-tooltip-href=\"//www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2050-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1\">Control Weather</a></h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b41d586e-5e52-4794-ad34-47d4175ef37b\">8th-level transmutation</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"bb9fa239-f939-4af7-b215-ddf2b9026709\">Casting Time:&nbsp;10 minutes</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"304c2881-b387-4c94-a0c1-1ad613b41e89\">Range:&nbsp;Self (5-mile radius)</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a39464ba-0c67-4559-b2da-145210f23d76\">Components:&nbsp;V, S, M (burning incense and bits of earth and wood mixed in water)</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4ae9669e-61be-4ba2-bffe-b5f1d7705bc3\">Duration:&nbsp;Concentration, up to 8 hours</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e2b7ae62-73ee-42ca-806c-945af2dca153\">You take control of the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration.

Agents of the Zhentarim feel that if they play by the rules, nothing gets done. Ultimately, they want to make the rules—and, in some cases, they already do. They walk a fine line when it comes to the letter of the law and don’t shy away from the occasional shady deal or illicit activity to get what they want.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\" data-content-chunk-id=\"cf5fc57a-dea8-4047-a5b9-23773061650b\">To the Zhentarim, wealth is power. Its agents know that nothing else inspires such confidence and dispels doubt so well. In an instant, wealth speaks louder than a thousand bards. Zhentarim agents routinely carry the finest weapons and armor, with no expense spared. When a merchant needs an escort for a caravan, when a noble family requires bodyguards to protect its holdings, or when a city is desperate for trained soldiers to defend its walls, the Zhentarim provides the best warriors money can buy.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;\" data-content-chunk-id=\"a35a55cf-b9f9-454e-9878-2ab6b8724ca2\">The organization encourages individual ambition and rewards innovators who take matters into their own hands.

It shares elements with childhood games of make-believe. Like those games, D&amp;D is driven by imagination. It&rsquo;s about picturing the towering castle beneath the stormy night sky and imagining how a fantasy adventurer might react to the challenges that scene presents.</p>\n<div data-content-chunk-id=\"6904b335-5d9e-4bf3-a1a6-bee1ad441eb5\">\n<blockquote data-content-chunk-id=\"6e9b961a-e892-44be-bcac-6e13d495eb90\">\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6f804636-2720-420e-b8ab-bf278fff7e7e\">Dungeon Master (DM):&nbsp;After passing through the craggy peaks, the road takes a sudden turn to the east and Castle Ravenloft towers before you. Crumbling towers of stone keep a silent watch over the approach. They look like abandoned guardhouses. Beyond these, a wide chasm gapes, disappearing into the deep fog below. A lowered drawbridge spans the chasm, leading to an arched entrance to the castle courtyard. The chains of the drawbridge creak in the wind, their rust-eaten iron straining with the weight. From atop the high strong walls, stone gargoyles stare at you from hollow sockets and grin hideously. A rotting wooden portcullis, green with growth, hangs in the entry tunnel. Beyond this, the main doors of Castle Ravenloft stand open, a rich warm light spilling into the courtyard.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b6655015-642f-4082-b36b-412d54a09234\">Phillip (playing Gareth):&nbsp;I want to look at the gargoyles. I have a feeling they&rsquo;re not just statues.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d508c6b9-a149-4fd3-9f90-141a83ef9564\">Amy (playing Riva):&nbsp;The drawbridge looks precarious? I want to see how sturdy it is. Do I think we can cross it, or is it going to collapse under our weight?</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a13c0fe2-558e-44b3-bd51-512b52e01e4c\">Unlike a game of make-believe, D&amp;D gives structure to the stories, a way of determining the consequences of the adventurers&rsquo; action. Players roll dice to resolve whether their attacks hit or miss or whether their adventurers can scale a cliff, roll away from the strike of a magical lightning bolt, or pull off some other dangerous task. Anything is possible, but the dice make some outcomes more probable than others.</p>\n<div data-content-chunk-id=\"666edfa5-9ed8-45ab-88f5-12a26ddb1cfb\">\n<blockquote data-content-chunk-id=\"538693c8-0c48-4449-a1c3-99e65d93a830\">\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"273cbb8d-9ac9-4c28-8f20-e2c7be164a08\">Dungeon Master (DM):&nbsp;OK, one at a time.

Is there any hint they might be creatures and not decorations?</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"7188efec-3e35-4863-88e9-cc12e2d7ca74\">DM:&nbsp;Make an Intelligence check.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"dd2feb85-b214-445d-82f7-7c8bc576359c\">Phillip:&nbsp;Does my Investigation skill apply?</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b2aadb94-718a-43cb-b382-b5156c4aa5ac\">DM:&nbsp;Sure!</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"1895fb28-6593-4be5-8856-5ce55d8228c6\">Phillip (rolling a d20):&nbsp;Ugh. Seven.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c77681f8-633a-4610-baea-af5f83284e3e\">DM:&nbsp;They look like decorations to you. And Amy, Riva is checking out the drawbridge?</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5938c4e8-4b61-4bb5-a4d3-167b87e2792c\">In the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game, each player creates an adventurer (also called a character) and teams up with other adventurers (played by friends). Working together, the group might explore a dark dungeon, a ruined city, a haunted castle, a lost temple deep in a jungle, or a lava-filled cavern beneath a mysterious mountain. The adventurers can solve puzzles, talk with other characters, battle fantastic monsters, and discover fabulous magic items and other treasure.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8fa9ad0f-835b-4201-a916-34da6840af4d\">One player, however, takes on the role of the Dungeon Master (DM), the game&rsquo;s lead storyteller and referee. The DM creates adventures for the characters, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The DM might describe the entrance to Castle Ravenloft, and the players decide what they want their adventurers to do. Will they walk across the dangerously weathered drawbridge? Tie themselves together with rope to minimize the chance that someone will fall if the drawbridge gives way? Or cast a spell to carry them over the chasm? Then the DM determines the results of the adventurers&rsquo; actions and narrates what they experience. Because the DM can improvise to react to anything the players attempt, D&amp;D is infinitely flexible, and each adventure can be exciting and unexpected.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"25435f60-5015-4d4c-85d7-13dad3c18ef8\">The game has no real end; when one story or quest wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing story called a&nbsp;campaign. Many people who play the game keep their campaigns going for months or years, meeting with their friends every week or so to pick up the story where they left off. The adventurers grow in might as the campaign continues. Each monster defeated, each adventure completed, and each treasure recovered not only adds to the continuing story, but also earns the adventurers new capabilities. This increase in power is reflected by an adventurer&rsquo;s level.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b571e685-c2d5-447e-9521-7c359d04c8a5\">There&rsquo;s no winning and losing in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game&mdash;at least, not the way those terms are usually understood. Together, the DM and the players create an exciting story of bold adventurers who confront deadly perils. Sometimes an adventurer might come to a grisly end, torn apart by ferocious monsters or done in by a nefarious villain. Even so, the other adventurers can search for powerful magic to revive their fallen comrade, or the player might choose to create a new character to carry on. The group might fail to complete an adventure successfully, but if everyone had a good time and created a memorable story, they all win.</p>\n<h2 id=\"WorldsofAdventure\" data-content-chunk-id=\"03be298f-153f-497f-8d37-7c013efbfbb6\">Worlds of Adventure</h2>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"08f0adf8-bd5e-461a-8380-f02accb33fd4\">The many worlds of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game are places of magic and monsters, of brave warriors and spectacular adventures. They begin with a foundation of medieval fantasy and then add the creatures, places, and magic that make these worlds unique.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"16503cf2-4939-42e5-8ba8-1c1b481507e9\">The worlds of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game exist within a vast cosmos called the multiverse, connected in strange and mysterious ways to one another and to other planes of existence, such as the Elemental Plane of Fire and the Infinite Depths of the Abyss. Within this multiverse are an endless variety of worlds. Many of them have been published as official settings for the D&amp;D game. The legends of the Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance, Greyhawk, Dark Sun, Mystara, and Eberron settings are woven together in the fabric of the multiverse. Alongside these worlds are hundreds of thousands more, created by generations of D&amp;D players for their own games. And amid all the richness of the multiverse, you might create a world of your own.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9e53d094-d456-459f-a7e1-fc3673727dc8\">All these worlds share characteristics, but each world is set apart by its own history and cultures, distinctive monsters and races, fantastic geography, ancient dungeons, and scheming villains. Some races have unusual traits in different worlds. The halflings of the Dark Sun setting, for example, are jungle-dwelling cannibals, and the elves are desert nomads. Some worlds feature races unknown in other settings, such as Eberron&rsquo;s warforged, soldiers created and imbued with life to fight in the Last War. Some worlds are dominated by one great story, like the War of the Lance that plays a central role in the Dragonlance setting. But they&rsquo;re all D&amp;D worlds, and you can use the rules here to create a character and play in any one of them.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e8374811-7504-44f9-b0c8-baddb48d4795\">Your DM might set the campaign on one of these worlds or on one that he or she created. Because there is so much diversity among the worlds of D&amp;D, you should check with your DM about any house rules that will affect your play of the game. Ultimately, the Dungeon Master is the authority on the campaign and its setting, even if the setting is a published world.</p>\n<h2 id=\"UsingTheseRules\" data-content-chunk-id=\"bb9bcccd-28d4-4890-a563-1358a51c4e0b\">Using These Rules</h2>\n<div data-content-chunk-id=\"38c1ff05-4633-406e-9d83-397a60ad50f3\">\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6cc4b888-75ad-410b-b0a4-440224e16481\">The D&amp;D Basic Rules document has four main parts.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6cc4b888-75ad-410b-b0a4-440224e16481\">Part 1&nbsp;is about creating a character, providing the rules and guidance you need to make the character you&rsquo;ll play in the game. It includes information on the various races, classes, backgrounds, equipment, and other customization options that you can choose from. Many of the rules in part 1 rely on material in parts 2 and 3.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6cc4b888-75ad-410b-b0a4-440224e16481\">Part 2&nbsp;details the rules of how to play the game, beyond the basics described in this introduction. That part covers the kinds of die rolls you make to determine success or failure at the tasks your character attempts, and describes the three broad categories of activity in the game: exploration, interaction, and combat.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6cc4b888-75ad-410b-b0a4-440224e16481\">Part 3&nbsp;is all about magic. It covers the nature of magic in the worlds of D&amp;D, the rules for spellcasting, and a selection of typical spells available to magic-using characters (and monsters) in the game.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6cc4b888-75ad-410b-b0a4-440224e16481\">Part 4&nbsp;is especially for the Dungeon Master. It contains instructions for how to challenge the player characters with adversaries that are a good test of their abilities, plus dozens of ready-to-use monster descriptions. It also provides a sampling of magic items that the characters can earn as their rewards for vanquishing those monsters.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"6cc4b888-75ad-410b-b0a4-440224e16481\">The end of the document contains supplemental material.&nbsp;<a title=\"Appendix A\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions\" data-content-chunk-id=\"3476b589-5e66-4352-a2be-03eba6700f30\">Appendix A</a>&nbsp;collects all the definitions of conditions that can affect characters and monsters.&nbsp;<a title=\"Appendix B\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/appendix-b-gods-of-the-multiverse\" data-content-chunk-id=\"9130648a-77c9-4b21-a539-ac25dcf8c0ee\">Appendix B</a>&nbsp;is a brief discussion of deities in the game, particularly those in the Forgotten Realms setting.&nbsp;<a title=\"Appendix C\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/appendix-c-the-five-factions\" data-content-chunk-id=\"5864e642-b826-4f23-b693-f73e41724bd6\">Appendix C</a>&nbsp;describes the five factions in the Forgotten Realms that characters can become associated with.&nbsp;<a title=\"Appendix D\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/appendix-d-the-planes-of-existence\" data-content-chunk-id=\"f7aec6e6-2870-4fca-91e3-d46f9258ae96\">Appendix D</a>&nbsp;explores the&nbsp;multitude of worlds and alternate dimensions of reality, called the planes of existence.

The DM describes the environment.</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"be0514c8-01d3-4085-9386-a8e96f2d8de5\">The DM tells the players where their adventurers are and what&rsquo;s around them, presenting the basic scope of options that present themselves (how many doors lead out of a room, what&rsquo;s on a table, who&rsquo;s in the tavern, and so on).</p>\n<h3 id=\"2Theplayersdescribewhattheywanttodo\" data-content-chunk-id=\"2e6e1829-6263-4f8f-91a4-49dbec621b4b\">2. The players describe what they want to do.</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"27c6ef46-5b97-47c6-82d9-e0c11db59c08\">Sometimes one player speaks for the whole party, saying, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take the east door,&rdquo; for example. Other times, different adventurers do different things: one adventurer might search a treasure chest while a second examines an esoteric symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps watch for monsters. The players don&rsquo;t need to take turns, but the DM listens to every player and decides how to resolve those actions.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"4e59be7c-d065-47a0-a292-aa536443b22a\">Sometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer wants to walk across a room and open a door, the DM might just say that the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a deadly trap, or some other circumstance might make it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the DM decides what happens, often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of an action.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3TheDMnarratestheresultsoftheadventurersactions\" data-content-chunk-id=\"8f172cf9-8acb-4e2e-884d-b45f215adef4\">3. The DM narrates the results of the adventurers&rsquo; actions.</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"08b2cbe7-519b-42a2-a504-a1dbfe37710a\">Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the flow of the game right back to step 1.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e87cf1fc-ea00-4606-98f2-95d35811df4f\">This pattern holds whether the adventurers are cautiously exploring a ruin, talking to a devious prince, or locked in mortal combat against a mighty dragon. In certain situations, particularly combat, the action is more structured and the players (and DM) do take turns choosing and resolving actions. But most of the time, play is fluid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances of the adventure.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5a0063f3-51e3-455d-92b1-4031b61404e8\">Often the action of an adventure takes place in the imagination of the players and DM, relying on the DM&rsquo;s verbal descriptions to set the scene. Some DMs like to use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the mood, and many players and DMs alike adopt different voices for the various adventurers, monsters, and other characters they play in the game. Sometimes, a DM might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures to represent each creature involved in a scene to help the players keep track of where everyone is.</p>\n<h4 id=\"GameDice\" data-content-chunk-id=\"2fe869fe-7e32-47aa-815f-6ef9f7808afa\">Game Dice</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a2f8ac62-7bc0-49fa-acc6-7d6b9f76042f\">The game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers of sides. You can find dice like these in game stores and in many bookstores.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"cb7099d1-48f3-431a-be84-33066179f15a\">In these rules, the different dice are referred to by the letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the typical cube that many games use).</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"99dc75ec-b7a4-4a16-9431-a974bb8627e5\">Percentile dice, or d100, work a little differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9. One die (designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and the other gives the ones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for example, the number rolled is 71. Two 0s represent 100. Some ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20, and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit from the ones digit. In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71, and 00 and 0 is 100.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ee1a0259-cebc-4ddf-8a58-031b53742221\">When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to add. For example, &ldquo;3d8 + 5&rdquo; means you roll three eight-sided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"32bf59a8-494b-4ef8-ae2f-b58a5348615b\">The same d notation appears in the expressions &ldquo;1d3&rdquo; and &ldquo;1d2.&rdquo; To simulate the roll of 1d3, roll a d6 and divide the number rolled by 2 (round up). To simulate the roll of 1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll depending on whether it was odd or even. (Alternatively, if the number rolled is more than half the number of sides on the die, it&rsquo;s a 2.)</p>\n<h4 id=\"TheD20\" data-content-chunk-id=\"e5c9383f-4aea-4778-bd59-f16d00a6b980\">The D20</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3429ef32-3d1a-4db9-ac74-b3b1a84430c7\">Does an adventurer&rsquo;s sword swing hurt a dragon or just bounce off its iron-hard scales? Will the ogre believe an outrageous bluff? Can a character swim across a raging river? Can a character avoid the main blast of a fireball, or does he or she take full damage from the blaze? In cases where the outcome of an action is uncertain, the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game relies on rolls of a 20-sided die, a d20, to determine success or failure.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"3f0c86cc-4fd4-461f-a74c-a4be1dd45939\">Every character and monster in the game has capabilities defined by six&nbsp;ability scores. The abilities are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18 for most adventurers. (Monsters might have scores as low as 1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the&nbsp;ability modifiers&nbsp;derived from them, are the basis for almost every d20 roll that a player makes on a character&rsquo;s or monster&rsquo;s behalf.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"821b0f86-98df-45a4-adbd-15c486bc2439\">Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the rules of the game. All three follow these simple steps.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1Rollthedieandaddamodifier\" data-content-chunk-id=\"97d03592-b97c-457e-8eb3-97ddf944a6f6\">1. Roll the die and add a modifier.</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"15d312c3-6f04-475e-9fd0-bd1055275a63\">Roll a d20 and add the relevant modifier. This is typically the modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and it sometimes includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a character&rsquo;s particular skill.&nbsp;(See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/step-by-step-characters\" data-content-chunk-id=\"2615b73a-37b1-44cc-abf9-a34903157417\">chapter 1</a>&nbsp;for details on each ability and how to determine an ability&rsquo;s modifier.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"2Applycircumstantialbonusesandpenalties\" data-content-chunk-id=\"05abcb74-6abd-4bd2-a8f9-306c53cb4228\">2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties.</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e1071f81-2e6c-4311-8805-6266ddb7e5bf\">A class feature, a spell, a particular circumstance, or some other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3Comparethetotaltoatargetnumber\" data-content-chunk-id=\"87e3b66a-47dc-4ecb-82f0-4c71ca3e9305\">3. Compare the total to a target number.</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"b6c2b600-1196-4fa4-ad33-249b8b62ddb4\">If the total equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s a failure. The&nbsp;DM&nbsp;is usually the one who determines target numbers and tells players whether their ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f597f1f9-d138-49a5-b1b5-b799eeca72ad\">The target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a&nbsp;Difficulty Class&nbsp;(DC). The target number for an attack roll is called an&nbsp;Armor Class&nbsp;(AC).</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"bb0a59b4-e767-4bf9-9b99-bd63cd73e468\">This simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks in D&amp;D play.&nbsp;<a title=\"Chapter 7\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores\" data-content-chunk-id=\"c10114db-b7cc-4df7-abef-c4320660feb4\">Chapter 7</a>&nbsp;provides more detailed rules for using the d20 in the game.</p>\n<h4 id=\"AdvantageandDisadvantage\" data-content-chunk-id=\"79f53a45-2ac1-4fbe-a5f9-f7492b160480\">Advantage and Disadvantage</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0574ed81-af9f-4eb6-a867-c27d408692a6\">Sometimes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is modified by special situations called advantage and disadvantage. Advantage reflects the positive circumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage reflects the opposite. When you have either advantage or disadvantage, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"990cbe7b-9be2-4783-8f60-55d01d9d32d5\">More detailed rules for advantage and disadvantage are presented in&nbsp;<a title=\"chapter 7\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores\" data-content-chunk-id=\"e9d7f609-f194-4ca3-a46c-c4a56d1862ba\">chapter 7</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"SpecificBeatsGeneral\" data-content-chunk-id=\"66a7424d-6f60-474e-81bf-0f1417511c60\">Specific Beats General</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"98fb4c86-0306-495f-94cf-bf0f9aaa87d2\">This book contains rules, especially in parts 2 and 3, that govern how the game plays. That said, many racial traits, class features, spells, magic items, monster abilities, and other game elements break the general rules in some way, creating an exception to how the rest of the game works. Remember this: If a specific rule contradicts a general rule, the specific rule wins.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c444db38-d878-4b5f-9524-30ddaf4de221\">Exceptions to the rules are often minor. For instance, many adventurers don&rsquo;t have proficiency with longbows, but every wood elf does because of a racial trait. That trait creates a minor exception in the game. Other examples of rule-breaking are more conspicuous. For instance, an adventurer can&rsquo;t normally pass through walls, but some spells make that possible. Magic accounts for most of the major exceptions to the rules.</p>\n<h4 id=\"RoundDown\" data-content-chunk-id=\"2bd75848-d6af-4dd8-b45b-5384dcb9a5b7\">Round Down</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c905c26b-a875-4172-9270-511fac4077c1\">There&rsquo;s one more general rule you need to know at the outset. Whenever you divide a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"Adventures\" data-content-chunk-id=\"c24de1dd-8153-4d35-bd5a-0e1ae3e75c98\">Adventures</h2>\n<div data-content-chunk-id=\"df0531c1-4829-494d-be00-ad6b9e9055b9\">\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"c086bdc9-1323-4e14-a4dc-199130e315b8\">The Dungeons &amp; Dragons game consists of a group of characters embarking on an adventure that the Dungeon Master presents to them. Each character brings particular capabilities to the adventure in the form of ability scores and skills, class features, racial traits, equipment, and magic items. Every character is different, with various strengths and weaknesses, so the best party of adventurers is one in which the characters complement each other and cover the weaknesses of their companions. The adventurers must cooperate to successfully complete the adventure.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"d7ad26d8-317b-404f-b019-d651625d900c\">The adventure is the heart of the game, a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. An adventure might be created by the Dungeon Master or purchased off the shelf, tweaked and modified to suit the DM&rsquo;s needs and desires. In either case, an adventure features a fantastic setting, whether it&rsquo;s an underground dungeon, a crumbling castle, a stretch of wilderness, or a bustling city. It features a rich cast of characters: the adventurers created and played by the other players at the table, as well as nonplayer characters (NPCs). Those characters might be patrons, allies, enemies, hirelings, or just background extras in an adventure. Often, one of the NPCs is a villain whose agenda drives much of an adventure&rsquo;s action.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"8c1095fd-4f30-4a6d-bb69-d8306e4eed94\">Over the course of their adventures, the characters are confronted by a variety of creatures, objects, and situations that they must deal with in some way. Sometimes the adventurers and other creatures do their best to kill or capture each other in combat. At other times, the adventurers talk to another creature (or even a magical object) with a goal in mind. And often, the adventurers spend time trying to solve a puzzle, bypass an obstacle, find something hidden, or unravel the current situation. Meanwhile, the adventurers explore the world, making decisions about which way to travel and what they&rsquo;ll try to do next.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"49cc021f-ff94-4249-9d6b-af56d05a4016\">Adventures vary in length and complexity. A short adventure might present only a few challenges, and it might take no more than a single game session to complete. A long adventure can involve hundreds of combats, interactions, and other challenges, and take dozens of sessions to play through, stretching over weeks or months of real time. Usually, the end of an adventure is marked by the adventurers heading back to civilization to rest and enjoy the spoils of their labors.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0fa45c4f-2740-4571-b071-02796f846c5a\">But that&rsquo;s not the end of the story. You can think of an adventure as a single episode of a TV series, made up of multiple exciting scenes. A campaign is the whole series&mdash;a string of adventures joined together, with a consistent group of adventurers following the narrative from start to finish.</p>\n<h3 id=\"TheThreePillarsofAdventure\" data-content-chunk-id=\"839c1f8b-f3e3-4824-a5b2-2392b16d381d\">The Three Pillars of Adventure</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"9804bcae-816e-40c5-b366-4e107b4acb57\">Adventurers can try to do anything their players can imagine, but it can be helpful to talk about their activities in three broad categories: exploration, social interaction, and combat.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"67bdded7-5473-49a7-9e3d-f9f050ab9482\">Exploration&nbsp;includes both the adventurers&rsquo; movement through the world and their interaction with objects and situations that require their attention. Exploration is the give-and-take of the players describing what they want their characters to do, and the Dungeon Master telling the players what happens as a result. On a large scale, that might involve the characters spending a day crossing a rolling plain or an hour making their way through caverns underground. On the smallest scale, it could mean one character pulling a lever in a dungeon room to see what happens.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"25e9a8fa-4114-4777-9437-449e422e896e\">Social interaction&nbsp;features the adventurers talking to someone (or something) else. It might mean demanding that a captured scout reveal the secret entrance to the goblin lair, getting information from a rescued prisoner, pleading for mercy from an orc chieftain, or persuading a talkative magic mirror to show a distant location to the adventurers.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"09c5e6ca-6075-4012-9d53-1f66e1b99e3d\">The rules in&nbsp;<a title=\"chapters 7\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores\" data-content-chunk-id=\"144abb23-463e-4a76-a73c-655ea73da437\">chapters 7</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title=\"8\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/adventuring\" data-content-chunk-id=\"f43de7c9-aaca-4ca3-8f98-cb329c598143\">8</a>&nbsp;support exploration and social interaction, as do many class features in&nbsp;<a title=\"chapter 3\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/classes\" data-content-chunk-id=\"f9aa7d91-8a9b-4694-be2f-0acef1896938\">chapter 3</a>&nbsp;and personality traits in&nbsp;<a title=\"chapter 4\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/personality-and-background\" data-content-chunk-id=\"936f8e24-39be-4847-88ae-1a810ae72bd5\">chapter 4</a>.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"e9574af0-8df2-4a59-97dd-43938c124a68\">Combat, the focus of&nbsp;<a title=\"chapter 9\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat\" data-content-chunk-id=\"5d9c857a-46dc-4897-9a39-49c6c52eb140\">chapter 9</a>, involves characters and other creatures swinging weapons, casting spells, maneuvering for position, and so on&mdash;all in an effort to defeat their opponents, whether that means killing every enemy, taking captives, or forcing a rout. Combat is the most structured element of a D&amp;D session, with creatures taking turns to make sure that everyone gets a chance to act. Even in the context of a pitched battle, there&rsquo;s still plenty of opportunity for adventurers to attempt wacky stunts like surfing down a flight of stairs on a shield, to examine the environment (perhaps by pulling a mysterious lever), and to interact with other creatures, including allies, enemies, and neutral parties.</p>\n<h2 id=\"TheWondersofMagic\" data-content-chunk-id=\"ef804e73-abb6-4c0b-bcce-7968d1b1b67a\">The Wonders of Magic</h2>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f3c2a29e-f1ca-4893-9b81-0b54df73b156\"><a href=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/4/988/intro01.png\" data-lightbox=\"1\" data-title=\"\"><img src=\"https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/4/988/380/545/intro01.png\" /></a></p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"a1189ae6-3475-4fa3-8776-043317546af9\">Few D&amp;D adventures end without something magical happening. Whether helpful or harmful, magic appears frequently in the life of an adventurer, and it is the focus of&nbsp;<a title=\"chapters 10\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/spellcasting\" data-content-chunk-id=\"834328e7-3147-470e-b46c-d13e7f87158f\">chapters 10</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title=\"11\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/spells\" data-content-chunk-id=\"b825f4ec-1ed0-404a-a46b-b1c359406c89\">11</a>.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"21325487-1f10-4082-8672-3af81275327a\">In the worlds of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, practitioners of magic are rare, set apart from the masses of people by their extraordinary talent. Common folk might see evidence of magic on a regular basis, but it&rsquo;s usually minor&mdash;a fantastic monster, a visibly answered prayer, a wizard walking through the streets with an animated shield guardian as a bodyguard.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"08c7de20-da59-4ca6-9e69-1417118d9113\">For adventurers, though, magic is key to their survival. Without the healing magic of clerics and paladins, adventurers would quickly succumb to their wounds. Without the uplifting magical support of bards and clerics, warriors might be overwhelmed by powerful foes. Without the sheer magical power and versatility of wizards and druids, every threat would be magnified tenfold.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ce0bcbc3-e1a1-49d4-9ec7-1e51e269c055\">Magic is also a favored tool of villains. Many adventures are driven by the machinations of spellcasters who are hellbent on using magic for some ill end. A cult leader seeks to awaken a god who slumbers beneath the sea, a hag kidnaps youths to magically drain them of their vigor, a mad wizard labors to invest an army of automatons with a facsimile of life, a dragon begins a mystical ritual to rise up as a god of destruction&mdash;these are just a few of the magical threats that adventurers might face. With magic of their own, in the form of spells and magic items, the adventurers might prevail!</p>\n</div>","_id":"yFEwLW12soGTlGAV"}

Can a fighter cut through a section of a stone wall with a sword? No, the sword is likely to break before the wall does.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"eb589eae-cd9d-47dd-b6da-c004f5451bec\">For the purpose of these rules, an object is a discrete, inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone, not a building or a vehicle that is composed of many other objects.</p>\n<h3 id=\"StatisticsforObjects\" data-content-chunk-id=\"b143a989-29bb-45bd-9dc1-e4a52383219a\">Statistics for Objects</h3>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"0d6b5eea-fd3f-4c07-b7d6-aeace7a174dd\">When time is a factor, you can assign an Armor Class and hit points to a destructible object. You can also give it immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities to specific types of damage.</p>\n<h4 id=\"ArmorClass\" data-content-chunk-id=\"6e9a34a7-a024-4362-8947-6d4c58eaf568\">Armor Class</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"34f0b2e8-04af-4ae7-a21d-5c923dd03cea\">An object's Armor Class is a measure of how difficult it is to deal damage to the object when striking it (because the object has no chance of dodging out of the way).

Resilient objects have more hit points than fragile ones. Large objects also tend to have more hit points than small ones, unless breaking a small part of the object is just as effective as breaking the whole thing. The Object Hit Points table provides suggested hit points for fragile and resilient objects that are Large or smaller.</p>\n<div>\n<table id=\"objectshitpoints\" data-content-chunk-id=\"5962487b-8783-46b0-8437-ec7d4d06cd3c\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Size</th>\n<th>Fragile</th>\n<th>Resilient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Tiny (bottle, lock)</td>\n<td>2 (1d4)</td>\n<td>5 (2d4)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Small (chest, lute)</td>\n<td>3 (1d6)</td>\n<td>10 (3d6)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium (barrel, chandelier)</td>\n<td>4 (1d8)</td>\n<td>18 (4d8)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large (Cart, 10-ft.-by-10-ft. window)</td>\n<td>5 (1d10)</td>\n<td>27 (5d10)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"HugeandGargantuanObjects\" data-content-chunk-id=\"93361c11-a1d7-4c55-808a-f1d3f1571e0b\">Huge and Gargantuan Objects</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"2a4f929e-dc8c-437c-9df0-579926d3606e\">Normal weapons are of little use against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, such as a colossal statue, towering column of stone, or massive boulder.

You can track a Huge or Gargantuan object's hit points if you like, or you can simply decide how long the object can withstand whatever weapon or force is acting against it. If you track hit points for the object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each section's hit points separately. Destroying one of those sections could ruin the entire object. For example, a Gargantuan statue of a human might topple over when one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 hit points.</p>\n<h4 id=\"ObjectsandDamageTypes\" data-content-chunk-id=\"8607399b-a261-4237-a127-cb319d1fdbe2\">Objects and Damage Types</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"fbd0d6d0-d35b-4937-ba0c-da418553aaa9\">Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage. You might decide that some damage types are more effective against a particular object or substance than others. For example, bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cutting through rope or leather. Paper or cloth objects might be vulnerable to fire and lightning damage. A pick can chip away stone but can't effectively cut down a tree. As always, use your best judgment.</p>\n<h4 id=\"DamageThreshold\" data-content-chunk-id=\"33d3d1e0-4f7f-42eb-af12-76079d2ade5f\">Damage Threshold</h4>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"f94589cf-126a-4e10-8475-d8b5972b74ff\">Big objects such as castle walls often have extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. An object with a damage threshold has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the object's damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn't reduce the object's hit points.</p>","_id":"yTxE4xmCeXch66ok"}
